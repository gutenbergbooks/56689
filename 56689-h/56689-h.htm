<p>The history of military nations exhibits periods of disaster
and success, when good and evil fortune, as if ruled by a
fatality, prevail. With some, in every essay, conquest crowns
their arms; while the bravest efforts of others terminate invariably
in defeat. Again, the best measures fail to obtain
success,—mischances follow thick upon each other,—possessions
are lost,—power declines,—and a name, before which a
world once trembled, becomes a by-word, and is rarely used
but to mark the mutability of national prosperity.</p>

<p>In looking back on past events, perhaps the gloomiest
period of British history will be found between the outbreak
of the war of independence, in 1775, and that of the French
revolution at the close of the last century. Conquest deserted
those banners which for ages she had crowned with victory,—the
days of England’s glory seemed departed,—and her
military dispositions were rendered nugatory by a thousand
accidental occurrences, which no human prudence could foresee.
Disciplined valour was defeated by the raw levies of
her own colonists, and her continental influence was placed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
abeyance for a time, by those splendid victories achieved by
the armies of the French Republic over the best organized and
best commanded troops in Europe.</p>

<p>Had the pride alone of Britain been lowered by the failure of
her arms, that circumstance would have been sufficiently
humiliating; but far more disastrous consequences resulted
from these continued defeats. The North American colonies
were wrested from the parent country, never to be recovered;
and a retention of her Indian possessions became a doubtful
question. French influence, too successfully employed with
almost every European cabinet, had already reached the
East; and the native princes, ripe for revolt, were only
awaiting a fitting moment to throw off the mask, and, by an
appeal to arms, free themselves from the thrall of a power
which in secret they both dreaded and detested. This state
of things was pregnant indeed with danger to Great Britain;
but bold and well-digested measures saved her in this her
political extremity; and when every thing was most heavily
overcast, the first promise of returning prosperity dawned, and
a future tide of conquest flowed from her earlier successes in the
East.</p>

<p>In 1797, the Marquis of Wellesley was nominated to the
Government of India; and on his arriving at the Presidency,
he found the British interests environed by a thousand perils.
Most of the native powers were avowedly inimical, or secretly
ill-disposed. It was known that the Sultaun of Mysore was
in active communication with the French Directory; that he
had tendered his alliance; that in return, he had received an
assurance of co-operation, and the assistance of European officers
to train his troops, accompanied by a liberal supply of
warlike stores. Tippoo Sultaun was also endeavouring to
influence Zemaun Schah to make a diversion on the northern
frontier of the English territory, pressing the Mahratta
powers to join the league, and make common cause against
the British by a simultaneous revolt. Scindia was notoriously
devoted to the French—and of course the Court of Deccan
was unfriendly. The Rajah of Berar was more than suspected
of disaffection; and Holkar, if not a declared enemy, could
not be regarded as a friend.</p>

<p>In this ominous aspect of Eastern affairs, nothing could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
have preserved India to Great Britain but prompt and daring
measures—and Lord Wellesley at once perceived that war
was inevitable—while the proclamation of the governor of the
Isle of France, and the landing on the coast of Malabar of
officers and men for Tippoo’s service, hurried the crisis. A
premature declaration would, however, have been impolitic.
The British armies were not ready for the field,—their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i>
was incomplete—their organization imperfect,—and, until
these deficiencies were remedied, Lord Wellesley determined
to delay the hour of hostile movements; and this, with admirable
tact, he managed to accomplish.</p>

<p>It was an object of paramount importance to interrupt the
native relations, if possible, and detach the Nizam from the
Sultaun of Mysore. The army of the former amounted to
fourteen thousand men, officered and disciplined by French
mercenaries. The Marquis applied himself to effect a new
treaty, by which the force at Hyderabad should be augmented,
and the French officers dismissed from the service of the
prince. These objects were happily effected. A moveable
column was despatched from Fort William—reached Hyderabad
by forced marches—and, assisted by the Nizam’s cavalry,
surrounded the infantry, arrested the officers, and disarmed
the sepoys. The Governor-General, finding himself now in
an attitude to commence hostilities, addressed a remonstrance
to Tippoo, which was unnoticed for some time. The advance
of the British army produced an unsatisfactory
reply; and, on the 22nd of February, war was formally
declared.</p>

<p>The British force, with which this short and brilliant campaign
was opened and completed, consisted of the army of the
Carnatic, under General Harris, and that of Cannanore, commanded
by Colonel Stuart. Including the corps at Hyderabad,
and the infantry of the Nizam, the former amounted to
thirty thousand men, to which a cavalry corps of six thousand
sabres was united. These were a contingent of the Nizam,
and commanded by an officer of his own—his son, Meer Allum.
The Western, or Cannanore corps, numbered about six thousand
five hundred.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March, the army of the Carnatic crossed the
frontier and carried some hill forts with trifling opposition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
while the corps under Stuart marched direct on Seringapatam.
Ascertaining that his capital was threatened, Tippoo broke up
from his cantonments, intending to attack the army of the
Carnatic; but suddenly changing his plans, he hurried
with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of his infantry to meet the division from Cannanore.</p>

<p>Never was the field taken with deadlier animosity to an
enemy than that with which Tippoo regarded his antagonists.
Like Hannibal’s to Rome, the hatred of the Sultaun to
Britain was hereditary and implacable. In the infancy of
English glory, a foe like him was reckoned truly formidable.
His military talents were considerable; and, with excellent
judgment, and untrammelled by Eastern presumption, he saw
the defects of native discipline, and laboured to remove them.
He had striven, and with success, through the agency of
Europeans, to introduce into his camp the improved systems of
modern warfare; and the army of the Mysore had, within a
few years, undergone a mighty change. Many confidential
communications that passed between the Sultaun and his chief
officers, found after the fall of the capital, prove with what
assiduity he had devoted his whole attention to the establishment
of a force that, by physical and numerical superiority,
should crush a power he detested, and overthrow England’s
dominion in the East. Tippoo’s infantry were tolerably
drilled—his artillery were respectable—and though his numerous
horse were quite unequal to meet and repel the combined
charge of British cavalry, still, as irregulars, they were excellent;
alike dangerous to an enemy from their rapid movement,
the audacity with which their sudden assault was made,
and the celerity, when repulsed, with which their retreat was
effected.</p>

<p>On the 5th, the Sultaun’s camp was indistinctly seen from
the British outposts. Four native battalions, commanded by
Colonel Montressor, were in advance at Seedaseer, and the
remainder of the division cantoned at a distance of from eight
to twelve miles in the rear. The country was difficult and
wooded; and to troops who were acquainted with its localities,
extremely favourable for taking an enemy by surprise.
From the detached position of the different brigades, Tippoo
could attack them in detail, and press with an overwhelming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
force the leading regiments under Montressor, and
probably cut them off before they could be supported from the
rear. So favourable an opportunity was not to be neglected—and
the Sultaun made his dispositions to attack the British
division the next morning.</p>

<p>A deep jungle lay between him and his enemy—and at
nine o’clock he passed through the brushwood undiscovered,
and threw himself furiously on the front and flanks of Montressor’s
brigade. Though surprised, and assailed under very
discouraging circumstances by a force immensely superior in
point of numbers, the sepoys behaved with veteran steadiness,
and fought most gallantly. Every effort made by Tippoo to
shake their formation failed. For five hours, these native
regiments sustained furious and repeated attacks unsupported;
and not until Stuart, after considerable opposition from the
Sultaun’s troops, who had gained the rear of Montressor, came
up and relieved this hard-pressed brigade, did the fiery
Sultaun desist from the assault. Unable longer to withstand
the united force opposed to him, Tippoo retired in disorder,
leaving fifteen hundred of his best troops upon the field,
while the British loss scarcely amounted to one hundred and
fifty.</p>

<p>Completely repulsed by the division of Cannanore, the
Sultaun did not renew the attack, but moved again to Bangalore,
and came up with the army of the Carnatic. After a
cavalry demonstration, which a few cannon-shot checked,
Tippoo fell back upon his capital—and General Harris continued
his march with all the despatch his defective means of
transport would permit.</p>

<p>The army of the Carnatic, taking the southern road to
Seringapatam, passed Karkunhully unopposed, crossed the
Madoor, and on the 27th reached Malavelly, where Tippoo
was drawn up in order of battle. Anxious to bring on an
action, Colonel Wellesley, with the Nizam’s troops, the 33rd
European regiment, and Floyd’s cavalry, advanced against
the left, while General Harris attacked the right. For a
time, Tippoo, by a rocket discharge and brisk cannonade strove
to arrest these forward movements—but the British advanced
steadily, and no effort which the Sultaun could make would
check them. A fine body of the Sultaun’s best troops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
amounting to two thousand, came boldly forward and attacked
the 33rd. Their reserved fire was received by the British at
some sixty yards, and answered by a bayonet rush. The
Sultaun’s infantry broke,—the British cavalry charged
home,—no quarter was given,—and an immense number
of the bravest of the native troops were bayoneted or cut
down.</p>

<p>Following up his success, Harris crossed the Cauvery,
Tippoo contenting himself with making a close reconnaissance
on the 2nd and 4th, as the British defiled along the heights.
On the 5th, the whole army took up its ground in front of
the city, and made preparations for immediately commencing
the siege.</p>

<p>Seringapatam stands on an island of bare and desolate
appearance, formed by the river Cauvery, which here divides
itself into separate streams—the waters creeping sluggishly
along for nearly three miles, when they again become united.
This insulated surface is in no place above a mile across—and
on its upper extremity the city is built, both channels
of the river flowing immediately beneath its walls.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The fortifications are in the Eastern style, the works irregular,
and the defences rather numerous than well-constructed.
Several walls, one within the other, connect
bastions of different forms; some being the ancient Hindu
tower, while others are of regular proportions, and formed
after the designs of European engineers. The point of attack
chosen by the British commander was the north-west angle of
the fort; and on the arrival of the Bombay army, which
joined on the evening of the 14th, the siege was vigorously
pressed.</p>

<p>The besiegers’ camp was judiciously selected, and distant
from the west face of the works about three thousand five
hundred paces. The right occupied a height, while the left
was protected by the Cauvery and an aqueduct. The rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
also, was effectually secured by steep ravines, and the watercourse
that supplied the greater canal. There were several
topes<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> within the lines, thickly planted with cocoa-trees and
bamboos, thus affording ample means for constructing ladders
and fascines. The place was healthy, the water pure and
abundant, and it possessed all the security of an intrenched
camp.</p>

<p>A part of the position however, in front of Tippoo’s advanced
posts, was within range of musketry and rockets, and it was
necessary that from these the enemy should be dislodged. A
night attack, under the command of Colonels Wellesley and
Shaw, was unsuccessful, and attended with considerable loss.
On the following day the whole line was stormed; the right
and left flanks and centre being simultaneously assaulted
under a heavy cannonade. On every point the attacks succeeded—and
a line of posts was gained, reaching from Sultaunpet
to the Cauvery, and advanced within eighteen hundred
yards of the fortress. On the west front, the Bombay
army were securely established within a thousand paces of that
angle of the fort; while a watercourse was seized on the
south, which allowed that face of the works to be invested
within less than nine hundred yards.</p>

<p>The siege was vigorously pressed—an intrenchment was
stormed on the evening of the 20th; and a parallel opened
within seven hundred and eighty paces of the works. On
the 22nd the garrison made a grand sortie, and fell in considerable
force upon the Bengal army; but their sustained
efforts were repulsed, and they were driven into the town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
with a loss of six hundred men. On the 26th, the enemy
having intrenched themselves behind a watercourse only three
hundred and eighty yards from the place, it was deemed
advisable to obtain its possession. It was accordingly assaulted
in gallant style, and carried, after an obstinate defence, that
cost both the victors and the vanquished a serious loss of life.</p>

<p>On the 30th a battery was unmasked, and commenced
breaching the bastion; on the 2nd of May, another was completed,
and opened a heavy fire on the curtain to the right—while
several guns of large calibre were gradually got to work.
The old masonry, unable to support this well-served and well-sustained
cannonade, began to yield—masses of the wall came
down into the ditch—a breach in the fausse-braye was reported
practicable—and on the 3rd of May, the face of the
bastion was in such a state of ruin, that preparations were
made for an immediate assault. In a brief letter,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> orders to
that effect were given next morning to Major-General Baird,
who had volunteered to command the storming party.</p>

<p>That the capture of Seringapatam should, to a certain
extent, have been achieved by the agency of Baird, appears
a striking act of retributive providence. He, who was to lead
on that resistless soldiery, by whose bayonets the life and
throne of Tippoo should be extinguished, had pined in hopeless
captivity, the tenant of a dungeon, in that capital which
he was to enter in a few hours a conqueror. In the melancholy
slaughter of Colonel Bailey and his troops by Hyder
Aly, on the 10th of September 1780,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Baird, then a captain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
was desperately wounded, made prisoner, hurried to Seringapatam,
and there subjected to treatment that, even at a period
remote from the event, cannot be heard without producing in
the reader a thrill of horror and disgust. Of the many who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
shared his captivity, few remained to narrate their sufferings.
Disease, starvation, poison, and the bowstring ended their
miserable lives: but a providential ordinance willed it that
Baird should survive—and, after disease failed to rob him of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
life, or temptation<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> deprive him of his honour, he was destined
to lead that band to vengeance, by whom a tyrant was
exterminated, and the power of Mysore prostrated to the
dust!</p>

<p>The arrangements for the assault were completed on the
evening of the 3rd—and two thousand five hundred Europeans,
and one thousand nine hundred native troops were
selected to carry it into execution. After sunset, ladders,
fascines, &amp;c. were conveyed into the trenches unnoticed by
the enemy; and before daybreak, the storming parties,
evading the observation of the garrison, marched quietly in,
and lay down until the order to assault was given.</p>

<p>One o’clock came—the city at that hour was perfectly
quiet,—while the trenches, to all appearance, contained
nothing but their ordinary guards. This tranquillity was
suddenly interrupted. Baird appeared, ordered the assault
to be given—and that word, “Forward!” annihilated an
empire, and changed a dynasty over an immense territory,
with a population almost countless, an army of three hundred
thousand men, and a revenue of five millions sterling. The
forlorn hope rushed on, followed closely by the columns under
Dunlop and Sherbroke—both plunging into the river under
a tremendous fire of rockets and musketry. The ford across
the Cauvery had been staked the preceding night, to mark the
passage the troops should take; but, in the hurry, they
swerved to the right, and getting into deeper water, the
progress of the column was retarded. Baird, observing the
difficulty, rushed on to the forlorn hope,—cheered the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
forward,—and in six minutes the British colours were flying
above the breach!</p>

<p>Filing off right and left, the storming parties pressed on.
The north-west bastion was carried—all went prosperously—although
the discovery of an inner ditch, filled with water,
was at first alarming. But the scaffolding used by Tippoo’s
workmen, and most fortunately left there undisturbed, enabled
the British to surmount every obstacle, and enter the body of
the place.</p>

<p>The right column halted on the east cavalier to give the
men breathing-time after violent exertion under a burning
sun. They awaited there a reinforcement of fresh troops to
proceed and assail the palace, where it was believed Tippoo
had retired. The report was untrue,—that palace he was
fated never to revisit,—for the tyrant of Mysore was then
gone to his account!</p>

<p>The left column, in the mean time, had overcome every
opposition, and continued their course along the ramparts, as
directed in the general order for the assault. Part of the 12th
regiment, however, either mistaking or disobeying orders,
rushed into the body of the town, and finding the sally-port
crowded with the Sultaun’s troops, commenced firing from the
inside on the archway, while the remainder of their own column
were keeping up a sharp fusilade upon it from the other
side. No wonder, thus enfiladed, that the passage was choked
with dead; and it was afterwards ascertained, on the removal
of the bodies, that above three hundred of the soldiers of
Mysore had fallen in this narrow space.</p>

<p>It is said, that to the moment of the assault, Tippoo never
supposed that an attempt would be made to storm the fortress;
and when the marching of the columns to the breach was
reported, he received the intelligence with incredulity. The
increasing uproar undeceived him, and rising from table, where
dinner had been laid under a thatched shed on the northern
face of the works, he performed his ablutions coolly, and called
for his horse and arms.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> At that moment the death of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
best officer was announced. The Sultaun paid a tribute to the
bravery of his favourite, named his successor, and rode forth
never to return.</p>

<p>On the left, Tippoo commanded in person; and here, the
traverses, erected to protect the breach, were so furiously
defended, that the assailants were completely checked. The
Sultaun fought among his meanest soldiers—and, if his attendants
can be trusted, several of the most daring of the
assailants were shot by the prince himself. Fortunately for
the British, by some unaccountable neglect, a passage from the
ditch to the rampart, by which the Sultaun’s working parties
passed from one place to the other, had been forgotten. By
this way, the 12th regiment reached the rampart, and pressing
quickly forward, turned the traverses, and poured in a flanking
fire that rendered them untenable. The troops that had
held them hitherto were now obliged to retire—the posts
were abandoned—and the Sultaun joined reluctantly his
retreating soldiery.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Fatigued, suffering from the intense heat, and pained by an
old wound, Tippoo mounted his horse, and retired slowly along
the northern rampart. The British were momentarily gaining
ground—the garrison in every direction flying—while a spattering
fusilade, and occasionally a wild huzza, told that the
victors were everywhere advancing. Instead of quitting the
city, as he might have done, the Sultaun crossed the bridge
over the inner ditch and entered the town. The covered gateway
was now crowded with fugitives vainly endeavouring to
escape from the bayonets of their conquerors, who were heard
approaching at either side. A random shot struck the Sultaun:
he pressed his horse forward, but his passage was impeded
by a mob of runaways, who literally choked the gloomy
arch. Presently a cross fire opened, and filled the passage
with the dead and wounded. Tippoo’s horse was killed, but
his followers managed to disengage him, dragged him exhausted
from beneath the fallen steed, and placed him in his
palanquin. But escape was impossible; the British were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
already in the gateway,—the bayonet was unsparingly at work—for
quarter at this moment was neither given nor expected.
Dazzled by the glittering of his jewelled turban, a soldier
dashed forward and caught the Sultaun’s sword-belt. With
failing strength, Tippoo cut boldly at his assailant and inflicted
a trifling wound. The soldier, irritated by pain, drew back,
laid his musket to his shoulder, and shot the Sultaun dead.
His companions, perceiving the struggle, rushed up; the
palanquin was overturned, the bearers cut down, the body of
the departed tyrant thrown upon a heap of the dead and
dying, and the corpse—despoiled of every thing valuable—left
among the fallen Mussulmans—naked, unknown, and unregarded.</p>

<p>The capital of Mysore was now at the mercy of the conquerors—and
the general’s first care was to seek out the dishonoured
body of its once haughty master. As it was suspected
that Tippoo had fallen in the northern gateway, the bodies
that lay heaped within it were hastily removed. For a time
the search was unsuccessful, and torches were obtained, as the
archway was low and gloomy. At last, beneath a heap of
slain Mussulmans, their ruler’s body was discovered. The
heat had not yet left the corpse; and though despoiled of
sword and belt, sash and turban,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> the well-known talisman
that encircled his right arm was soon recognised by the conquerors.
The amulet, formed of some metallic substance of
silvery hue, was surrounded by magic scrolls in Arabic and
Persian characters, and sewed carefully in several pieces of
richly-flowered silk. The eyes were unclosed; the countenance
wore that appearance of stern composure, which induced the
lookers-on for a time to fancy that the proud spirit of the
haughty Sultaun was still lingering in its tenement of clay.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
The pulse was examined—its throbs were ended—and life was
totally extinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
The body was directly removed to the palace, and there
respectfully deposited until the necessary preparations for an
honourable interment were completed—the funeral being conducted
with all the ceremonies which Eastern forms require.
As the procession moved slowly through the city, a “keeraut”
of five thousand rupees was distributed to the fakirs—and
verses from the Koran were repeated by the chief of the priests,
and responded by the assistants. Minute-guns were fired from
the batteries; and a guard of honour, composed of European
flank companies, followed the remains of the late ruler of
Mysore to the sepulchre of his once haughty father.</p>

<p>Tippoo, notwithstanding his cruelty and despotism, was
highly regarded by his Mussulman subjects. His was no
common character,—brave, munificent, and a bigot to his faith,
he was just the sovereign to excite Eastern admiration. A
rigid observer of the Prophet’s ordinances, he attended strictly
to the formulae of his religion—wine was strictly inhibited—and
every unbeliever, not excepting his favourite <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">employées</i>,
were treated with scorn and distrust. His establishment and
household were formed on a scale of regal splendour; and
when, by accident or age, their services were no longer efficient,
Tippoo never permitted a servant to be discharged, although
their numbers became incredible.</p>

<p>With all the sternness of character and high-souled energy
for which the departed Sultaun was remarkable, it would
appear that he was prone to superstition, and not endued with
that blind reliance upon Providence which, among Mussulmans,
distinguishes the true believer. It is said, that the day
doomed to be fatal to his empire and himself had been announced;
and that, forewarned of impending calamity, he had
vainly endeavoured to avert misfortune by resorting to magic
ceremonies, and obtaining the interference of the Brahmins
with their gods. Though a devoted follower of Mahomet, he
offered these priests an oblation of money, buffaloes, an elephant,
black she-goat, and dresses of cloth-beseeching them
to use their influence with Heaven for his prosperity. A
presentiment of coming danger had evidently cast its shadows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
before, and those immediately around the Sultaun’s person<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
remarked that he was heavily depressed. Yet his confidence
in the strength of the city and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of its garrison was
unbounded. He believed that Seringapatam was impregnable,
and laughed to scorn the idea that the British would ever
dream of carrying it by assault.</p>

<p>His funeral was marked by natural occurrences, that seemed
in happy keeping with the obsequies of him who had left an
empire for a tomb. On the evening when Tippoo was committed
to his kindred dust, the sky became overcast, and a
storm broke suddenly in a torrent of rain, while heaven seemed
in a blaze,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and peal after peal of thunder appeared to shake
the city to its very foundations, and added to the fearful
uproar. A tempest of more violence was hardly recollected;
and it seemed as if an elemental convulsion had been decreed,
to announce that the once haughty tyrant of Mysore was
nothing now but dust and ashes.</p>

<p>The storming of Seringapatam was certainly a bold and
hazardous attempt—it was nobly executed, and deserved the
success it gained. The moment for action was happily selected.
An Indian sun, when in meridian power, obliges man to avoid
its exhausting influence, and hence, that period of the day is
habitually made in Hindoostan an hour of repose and sleep.
Never supposing that at this season of relaxation any attempt
upon the fortress would be made, with the exception of the
guards alone, the Sultaun’s troops were sleeping in their
respective barracks. When the alarm was given, a panic
spread; and profiting by the confusion, the assailants increased
it, and prevented any attempt being made for an
efficient rally and defence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
To other circumstances, however, the fortunate result of
the attack may in a great measure be attributed. By an unpardonable
oversight the breach was unprovided with a retrenchment,
and the workmen’s passage, between the ditch
and rampart, left undefended. Had the breach been properly
retrenched, it could not have been surmounted in the face
of such a garrison; and traverses, that could have been, and
were, most obstinately defended, were lost to the besieged by
their stupid neglect in having left a means of escalade from
the ditch, which the labour of a dozen men would have rendered
impracticable. How frequently in war do great results
arise from trifling causes.</p>

<p>Every care was taken to prevent plunder and violence in
the night. The inhabitants were assured of protection; and
the Sultaun’s children kindly received by General Baird, and
for better security sent from the fortress to the camp. Even
before Tippoo’s death was ascertained, great delicacy was
observed in searching the palace, where it was supposed he had
concealed himself. The zenana, which contained his women,
was scrupulously respected—and a guard was merely drawn
around it to prevent the Sultaun’s escape, in the event of his
having made that his place of refuge.</p>

<p>Though eight thousand of Tippoo’s garrison fell in the
assault, very few of the inhabitants suffered. The British
loss during the siege and storm was, of course, severe; twenty-five
officers were killed or wounded in the assault; and the
total casualties were, of Europeans, twenty-two officers killed,
forty-five wounded, eighty-one rank and file killed, six hundred
and twenty-two wounded, and twenty-two missing; of
the native army, one hundred and nineteen were killed, four
hundred and twenty wounded, and one hundred missing,
making a general total of one thousand five hundred and
thirty-one <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>Having made necessary arrangements for the protection of
the town, Baird marched the 33rd and 74th regiments to the
palace, and in one of its magnificent courts the soldiers piled
arms, and established their bivouac.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Sentries were placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
around the zenana for its security; and the general slept on
a carpet spread for his accommodation under the verandah.
There lay the conqueror of Seringapatam, surrounded by his
victorious soldiers, and dispensing protection to the helpless
family of the fallen Sultaun. There he lay, on whose breath
hung life and death—yet but a few years back, and within
three hundred yards of the spot he rested on, that man had
occupied a dungeon, dragging on a cheerless captivity, and
waiting until the poisoned cup should be presented by “the
bondsman of a slave,” or the order delivered for his midnight
murder.</p>

<p>Is not the romance of real life oftentimes wilder far than
any creation of the imagination?</p>

<p>The tyrant of Mysore was gone to his account, and “how
his audit stood none knew save Heaven;” but assuredly a
more tiger-hearted monster never disgraced the musnud. His
conduct to the European prisoners after Hyder’s death was
atrocious. Of those taken with Bailey, the greater proportion
perished from starvation and disease; while Matthews
and his officers, who had surrendered under the usual conditions
granted in honourable warfare, and guaranteed by
Tippoo himself, were savagely murdered. Some of them were
led out at night, taken to a retired spot, and hewn in pieces—while
seventeen were poisoned with the milk of the cocoa-nut
tree. The death of the unhappy general was probably the
most horrible of all. Apprised by some means of the fate that
was impending, he refused the food sent by the keeladar, and
obtained, from the compassion of the guard and servants, as
much of theirs as merely sustained existence—the havildar
who had him in charge humanely conniving at the proceeding.
But when Tippoo learned that his victim still lived, the
havildar was sent for, and it was intimated that if his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
prisoner existed beyond a certain time, his own life should
pay the penalty of his humanity. The wretched instrument
of tyranny communicated what had passed to the devoted
general, and gave him the alternative of death from poison or
starvation. “For a few days the love of life maintained a
struggle with the importunate calls of hunger. These, however,
prevailed in the issue of the contest—he ate of the
poisoned food, and drank too—whether to quench the rage of
inflamed thirst, or to drown the torments of his soul in utter
insensibility—of the poisoned cup; and in six hours after the
fatal repast he was found dead.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The last acts of Tippoo’s life were in fit keeping with a
career marked throughout by perfidy and bloodshed. In the
confusion of the night of the 5th, when Colonel Wellesley’s
attack on Sultaunpet failed from darkness and the intricacy
of the betel tope, twelve grenadiers of the 33rd were made
prisoners, and brought into Seringapatam. At midnight they
were murdered by threes—“the mode of killing them was by
twisting their heads, while their bodies were held fast, and
thus breaking their necks.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> The fact was ascertained beyond
doubt, for a peon pointed out the place where these ill-fated
soldiers were interred, and they were examined and identified
by their own officers. Other English soldiers who had been
taken in assaulting outposts during the siege, had also been
put to death, “having nails driven through their skulls.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>In alluding to the Sultaun’s death, the regretted biographer
of Sir David Baird says, “One cannot but regret, for the
honour of human nature, and even for the sake of England,
the end of such a man as Tippoo, shot in cold blood by a man
endeavouring to rob him. Let us hope the man was a sepoy.”
The man was an Irish soldier, who many years afterwards
stated the fact in confession, and when <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in articulo mortis</i>.
“Cold blood!” Could blood be cold during the storm of a
defended city, and under an Indian sun almost at noon?</p>

<p>The tyrant only met the doom he merited. For his talents
we give him credit—his courage obtains our admiration—his
munificence we admit—but for the murderer of the brave we
feel neither sympathy nor regret.</p>

<p>The death of Tippoo Saib, and the fall of Seringapatam,
were astounding tidings for the native chiefs. Their delusory
notions regarding their individual importance were ended—and
a striking proof had been given of what little reliance
could be placed on Indian mercenaries and places of strength,
when England went forth in wrath and sent her armies to the
field.</p>

<p>As the fear of Britain became confirmed, so did the hatred
of the native princes to every thing connected with her name.
A power that had proved herself so formidable was to be
dreaded, fixed as she was in the very heart of India: and, as
the difficulty increased, so did the desire of freeing themselves
from that thrall, which daily appeared to press upon them
more heavily.</p>

<p>With political history we have no business, farther than
regards the military operations we detail; but, as warfare
originates in state policy, the elucidation of the one will
occasionally require that brief allusions should be made to the
other.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners delivered by the British from their
dungeons after the reduction of the capital of Mysore, was a
Mahratta trooper, who had commenced his predatory career
in the cavalry of Hyder Aly, and, after his death, continued
in the service of his son. For some cause he deserted, headed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
a band of marauders, was enticed back by the false promises
of Tippoo, flung into a dungeon, and there made a Mussulman,
greatly against his own will, and much to the glory of the
Prophet. “No sooner were his fetters off, than his feet were
again in the stirrup; and many of Tippoo’s horsemen, men of
desperate fortunes, without a country, a service, or a master,
became his willing followers.” His predatory band became
so numerous that he overran the district of Biddenore—and
at last he became so formidable, that a strong British force
was sent to crush him and his robber horde. It was effected—six
hundred and fifty of his followers were cut to pieces,
and himself driven across the Toombudra into the country of
the Peishwah. But here he was not permitted to rest.
Ghokla surprised him, and routed him totally, taking his
cannon, elephants, tents, and baggage. With difficulty the
freebooter escaped, fled none knew where, and in a short time,
Dhoondia was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the daring freebooter appeared again;
and moving south at the head of five thousand horse, threatened
the frontier of the Mysore, and naturally occasioned
immense alarm over a country so open to his predatory visits.
No time was lost in despatching a sufficient force to crush
him altogether, or compel him to retire, and Colonel Wellesley
was intrusted with the command. Another force was directed
to co-operate with that of the colonel; but fearing the
marauder would escape unless promptly encountered, Wellesley
pushed on alone, and by forced marches succeeded in
coming up with him, while Dhoondia was encamped, as he
imagined, in perfect security. The fellow, naturally daring,
took up a strong position, and boldly waited for the British
assault. Colonel Wellesley led the charge—it was admirably
made, and the marauder’s fate was decided. His cavalry
were cut to pieces or dispersed, Dhoondia himself sabred, and
his body, secured upon a gun, was brought in triumph to the
camp. Thus perished the king of “the two worlds,”—for
such was the unassuming title by which the freebooter was
pleased to have himself designated by his banditti.</p>

<p>An intended expedition against Batavia, in which Colonel
Wellesley was promised a command, was for some reasons
abandoned. Baird, with a division, was despatched to Egypt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
by the Desert rout; and Wellesley reappointed to the government
of the Mysore.</p>

<p>Affairs again began to assume a threatening look. The
Mahratta chiefs exhibited an unfriendly attitude; and to
cement an alliance with the Peishwah, and thus tranquillize
the country, a portion of Tippoo’s territory was offered and
rejected. Scindia, with his army, was at Poona—and his
influence directed every act of that dependent court.</p>

<p>A misunderstanding between Scindia and Holkar brought
on a war between those chiefs. Holkar advanced on Poona,
compelling Scindia to accept battle, in which he was defeated—the
Peishwah deserting his ally in the hour of need, and
concluding a treaty with the British. To effectuate this,
Wellesley, now a major-general, took the field, with orders
to drive Holkar from Poona, and secure the Peishwah’s return
to his capital—and learning that the Mahrattas intended to
plunder Poona, the general saved it by an extraordinary
forced march, accomplishing sixty miles in thirty hours—a
marvellous exertion indeed to be made under an Indian sun.</p>

<p>All for a short time was quiet; but those restless chiefs
again assumed a hostile position. Scindia and the Rajah of
Berar moved towards the Nizam’s frontier; while the former
was negotiating with Holkar, his late enemy, to arrange their
differences, and make common cause against the English.</p>

<p>To prepare for the threatened attack, the Marquis Wellesley
invested the officers commanding the armies of Hindoostan
and the Deccan with full powers; and to General Wellesley
a special authority was given to make peace, or commence
hostilities, as his own judgment should determine. In accordance
with this power, a demand was made on Scindia that he
should separate from the Rajah of Berar, and re-cross the
Nerbuddah. To this demand an evasive reply was returned—and
Eastern cunning was employed to obtain such delay as
should permit the chieftains’ plans to be matured, and enable
them to take the field in force. This shuffling policy was,
however, quite apparent; and on the first information that his
political agent had quitted Scindia’s camp, Wellesley suddenly
broke up his cantonments, and marched directly on Ahmednuggur.</p>

<p>This ancient town was defended in the Eastern fashion with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
a high wall, flanked at its bends and angles by a tower, and
garrisoned by some of Scindia’s infantry and an auxiliary
force of Arabs, while a body of the chieftain’s cavalry occupied
the space between the pettah and the fort. Wellesley,
without delay, assaulted the town, and carried it by escalade.
On the 10th, the British cannon opened on the fort—the
keeladar in command proposed terms, and the English
general expressed a readiness to listen to his propositions, but
the guns continued working. Indian diplomacy has no chance
when batteries are open; and, on the 12th, a garrison of fourteen
hundred marched out, and the place was delivered up.
This fortress, from its locality, was valuable; it secured the
communications with Poona, made a safe depôt for military
stores, and was centrically placed in a district whose revenue
was above 600,000 rupees.</p>

<p>With a short delay, Wellesley moved on Aurungabad, and
entered that splendid city on the 29th. The enemy moved in
a south-easterly direction, threatening Hyderabad—while the
British, marching by the left bank of the Godaverey, secured
their convoys from Moodgul, and obliged Scindia to retire
northwards. As yet the Mahratta chiefs were moving a
cavalry force north, with but a few matchlock-men; but they
were joined now by their whole artillery and sixteen battalions
of infantry, officered chiefly by Frenchmen.</p>

<p>On the 21st, at a conference at Budnapoor, General
Wellesley and Colonel Stevenson arranged a combined attack
for the 24th. They were to move east and west, pass the
defiles on the same day, and thus prevent any movement of
the enemy southward. A mistake, in distance, brought General
Wellesley much sooner to his halting-place than had been
calculated; and learning that the Mahratta army were already
breaking up to retire, he sent orders to Colonel Stevenson to
advance; and announcing his immediate march on Scindia,
begged his colleague to hurry forward to his assistance.</p>

<p>The cavalry consisted of the 19th Light Dragoons, and
three native regiments, under the command of Colonel Maxwell,
a bold and skilful officer. General Wellesley accompanied
the horse—the infantry following in light marching
order. After passing a league and half of ground, the advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
reached an eminence; and on the right, and covering an immense
extent of country, the Mahratta army appeared.</p>

<p>In brilliant sunshine, nothing could be more picturesque
than Scindia’s encampment. The varied colours of the tents,
each disposed around its own chieftain’s banner without order
or regularity, with “streets crossing and winding in every
direction, displayed a variety of merchandise, as in a great
fair. Jewellers, smiths, and mechanics were all attending as
minutely to their occupations, and all as busily employed, as
if they were at Poona, and in peace.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>In this enormous camp, fifty thousand men were collected—the
river Kaitna running in their front—the Suah in their
rear. These rivers united their waters at some distance beyond
the left of the camp, forming a flat peninsula of considerable
extent. The native infantry and all the guns were in position
on the left, retired upon the Suah, and appuied on the village
of Assaye—the cavalry were entirely on the right. The
position was naturally strong; for the banks of the Kaitna
are steep and broken, and the front very difficult to attack.</p>

<p>As the British cavalry formed line on the heights, it presented
a strange but glorious contrast to the countless multitude
of Mahratta horsemen, who were seen in endless array
below. The English brigade, scarcely numbering three thousand
sabres, took its position with all the boldness of a body
having an equal force opposed. In number Scindia’s cavalry
were fully ten to one; as it was ascertained that, with his
allies, the horsemen actually on the field exceeded thirty thousand.
Having made a careful reconnaissance, General Wellesley
determined to attack—and, when the infantry came up, it
was instantly executed.</p>

<p>While examining the position, immense masses of Scindia’s
cavalry moved forward, and threw out skirmishers, which were
directly driven in. Wellesley having discovered a neglected
ford, decided on crossing over, and, by attacking the infantry
and guns, embarrass the immense cavalry force of Scindia, and
oblige it to manœuvre to disadvantage, and act on the confined
space the ill-selected ground afforded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
The infantry had now come up, and, in column, they were
directed on the river. A fire from the Mahratta guns immediately
opened, but the range was far too distant to permit
the cannonade to be effective, or check the forward movement
of the columns. The whole were now across the river; the
infantry formed into two brigades, and the cavalry in reserve
behind them, ready to rush on any part of the battle-ground
where advantage could be gained, or support should be required.
The Mysore horse and the contingent of the Peishwah
were merely left in observation of the enemy’s right.</p>

<p>This flank attack obliged Scindia to change his front. He
did so with less confusion than was expected; and by his new
disposition rested his right upon the Kaitna, and his left upon
the Suah and Assaye. His whole front bristled with cannon—and
the ground immediately around the village seemed,
from the number of guns, like one great battery.</p>

<p>The fire from this powerful artillery was of course destructive;
and the British guns were completely overpowered, and
in a very few minutes silenced entirely. This was the crisis;
and on the determination of a moment hung the fortune of a
very doubtful day. Without hesitation Wellesley abandoned
his guns, and advanced with the bayonet. The charge was
gallantly made, the enemy’s right forced back, and his guns
captured.</p>

<p>While this movement was being executed, the 74th and
light infantry pickets in front of Assaye, were severely cut
up by the fire from that place. Perceiving the murderous
effect of the fusilade, a strong body of the Mahratta horse
moved swiftly round the village, and made a furious onset on
the 74th. Maxwell had watched the progress of the battle,
and now was his moment of action. The word was given,—the
British cavalry charged home—down went the Mahrattas
in hundreds beneath the fiery assault of the brave 19th,
and their gallant supporters the sepoys; while, unchecked by
a tremendous storm of grape and musketry, Maxwell pressed
his advantage, and cut through Scindia’s left. The 74th and
the light infantry reformed, and, pushing boldly on, completed
the disorder of the enemy, preventing any effective attempt to
renew a battle, the doubtful result of which was thus in a few
minutes decided by the promptitude of the general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Some of Scindia’s troops fought bravely—and the desperate
obstinacy with which his gunners stood to the cannon, was
almost incredible. They remained to the last—and were
bayoneted around the guns, which they refused, even in certain
defeat, to abandon.</p>

<p>The British charge was, indeed, resistless; but in the enthusiasm
of success, at times there is a lack of prudence. The
sepoys rushed wildly on—their elated ardour was uncontrollable—while
a mass of the Mahratta horse arrayed upon the
hill, were ready to rush upon ranks disordered by their own
success.</p>

<p>But Wellesley foresaw, and guarded against the evil consequences
that a too excited courage might produce. The
78th were kept in hand; and cool, steady, and with a perfect
formation, they offered an imposing front, that the Mahratta
cavalry perceived was unassailable.</p>

<p>A strong column of the enemy, however, that had been only
partially engaged, now rallied and renewed the battle, joined
by a number of Scindia’s gunners and infantry, who had
flung themselves as dead upon the ground, and thus escaped
the sabres of the British cavalry. Maxwell’s brigade, who
had re-formed their ranks and breathed their horses, dashed
into the still disordered ranks of these half-rallied troops—a
desperate slaughter ensued, and the Mahrattas were totally
routed; but the British lost their chivalrous leader—and in
the moment of victory, Maxwell died in front of the battle,
“and, fighting foremost, fell.”</p>

<p>The last effort of the day was made by a part of the artillery
who were in position near the village of Assaye—and in
person Wellesley led on the 78th Highlanders and the 7th native
cavalry. In the attack the general’s horse was killed under
him; but the enemy declined the charge, broke, fled, and left
a field cumbered with their dead, and crowded with cannon,
bullocks, caissons, and all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of an Eastern army, to
the conquerors.</p>

<p>The evening had fallen before the last struggle at Assaye
was over—but the British victory was complete. Twelve
hundred of Scindia’s dead were found upon the field; while,
of his wounded, scarcely an estimate could be hazarded, for all
the villages and adjacent country were crowded with his disabled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
soldiery. The British loss was of necessity severe, and
it might be estimated that one-third of the entire army was
rendered <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>To call Assaye a brilliant victory, is only using a term simply
descriptive of what it was. It was a magnificent display
of skill, moral courage, and perfect discipline, against native
bravery and an immense numerical superiority. But it was
not a mass of men, rudely collected, ignorant of military tactics,
and unused to combinations, that Wellesley overthrew.
Scindia’s army was respectable in every arm, his cavalry excellent
of their kind, and his artillery well served. His infantry
were for a long time under the training of French officers;
and the ease and precision with which he changed his front
when the British crossed the Kaitna to assail his flank, shewed
that the lessons of the French disciplinarians had not been
given in vain.</p>

<p>The total <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i> of Assaye was followed by a tide of conquest.
Fortress after fortress was reduced, and Scindia sought
and obtained a truce. The British arms were next turned
against the Rajah of Berar—General Wellesley marched against
him—for the truce was ended suddenly, and Scindia joined his
colleague with all his disposable force.</p>

<p>On the plains of Argaum Wellesley found the confederated
chiefs drawn up in order of battle. Scindia’s immense
cavalry formed the right—on the left were the Berar infantry
and guns, flanked by the Rajah’s cavalry—while a cloud of
Pindaries were observed on the extreme right of the whole
array.</p>

<p>The British moved down and formed line, the infantry in
front, and the cavalry in reserve. The battle was short and
decisive. The Berar’s Persian infantry attacked the 74th
and 78th regiments, and were literally annihilated; while
Scindia’s cavalry charge failed totally, the 26th native regiment
repulsing it most gloriously. The British now rushed
forward—and the Mahrattas broke and fled in every direction,
abandoning their entire park;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> while the cavalry pursued
by moonlight the scattered host, and captured an immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
number of elephants and beasts of burden, the entire baggage,
and stores and arms of every description.</p>

<p>The fall of some places of strength, and the total defeat of
their armies in the field, humbled Scindia and his ally, the
Rajah, and obliged them to sue and obtain a peace. The
brilliant career of General Wellesley had gained him a name
in arms, which future victories were to immortalize. To
commemorate the battle of Assaye, a monument was erected
in Calcutta, a sword presented to the victor by the citizens,
and a gold vase by the officers he commanded. He was also
made a Knight Companion of the Bath, and honoured by the
thanks of Parliament. Even from the inhabitants of Seringapatam
he received an address, remarkable for its simplicity
and affection, committing him to the care of “the God of all
castes,” and invoking for him “health, glory, and happiness.”
In 1805 he returned to his native land, “with war’s red
honours on his crest,” bearing with him from the scene of his
glory the high estimation and affectionate wishes of every
caste and colour.</p>

<p>Whether the employment of a British force in Egypt, under
the circumstances Europe then presented, was a judicious disposal
of it, is a question that would involve too large a political
inquiry; “but certain it is that any positive object would
have been preferable to the indeterminate counsels and feebly
executed plans which wasted the soldiers’ health and spirits,
compromised the honour of the army, and so materially prejudiced
the interests of a country.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>In 1800, an attempt on Cadiz was planned and abandoned;
and an army, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps élite</i> of Britain, was kept idly afloat
in transports at an enormous expense, suffering from tempestuous
weather, and losing their energies and discipline,
while one scheme was proposed after another, only to be considered
and rejected. By turns Italy and South America were
named as countries where they might be successfully employed—but
to both designs, on mature deliberation, strong objections
were found; and on the 25th of October final orders were received
from England, directing the fleet and army forthwith
to rendezvous at Malta, and thence proceed to Egypt.</p>

<p>The troops on reaching the island were partially disembarked
while the ships were refitting; and the fresh provisions
and salubrious air of Valetta soon restored many who had
suffered from long confinement and salt rations. Five hundred
Maltese were enlisted to serve as pioneers. Water-casks were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
replenished, stores laid in, the troops re-embarked; and on
the 20th of December, the first division got under weigh,
followed by the second on the succeeding day.</p>

<p>Instead of sailing direct for their destination, the fleet proceeded
to the Bay of Macri. Finding that roadstead too open,
the admiral shaped his course for the coast of Caramania.
There he was overtaken by a gale of wind,—and though close
to the magnificent harbour of Marmorrice, its existence appears
to have been known, out of a fleet of two hundred vessels, only
to the captain of a brig of war. As the fleet were caught in a
heavy gale on a lee shore, the result might have been most disastrous
to the transports, who could not carry sufficient canvas to
work off the land. Fortunately, Marmorrice proved a haven
of refuge; and the surprise and pleasure of the soldiers can
scarcely be described, when they found themselves in smooth
water, and surrounded by the grandest scenery imaginable,
“though, the instant before, the fleet was labouring in a heavy
gale, and rolling in a tremendous sea.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Another landing of the troops took place, and no advantages
resulted from it to compensate the loss of time which allowed
the French to obtain strong reinforcements. Goat’s flesh was
abundant, and poultry plentiful; but the Turks had probably
been apprised beforehand of the munificence of the English,
as every article was advanced on the arrival of the fleet four
hundred per cent. in price.</p>

<p>The remount of the cavalry formed an ostensible, almost an
only reason, for the expedition visiting Asia Minor, and consuming
time that might have been so successfully employed.
The horses arrived, but from their wretched quality and condition
they proved a sorry equivalent for the expense and
trouble their acquisition cost.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
While the expedition was in the harbour of Marmorrice, an
awful tempest came suddenly on, and raged with unintermitting
fury for two days. It thundered violently—hailstones fell as
large as walnuts—deluges of water rushed from the mountains,
sweeping every thing away. The horses broke loose—the ships
drove from their anchors—the Swiftsure, a seventy-four, was
struck with lightning—and many others lost masts, spars, and
were otherwise disabled. Amid this elemental war, signal-guns
fired from vessels in distress, and the howling of wolves and
other wild animals in the woods, added to the uproar.</p>

<p>After a protracted delay in waiting for the Turkish armament,
which was expected to have been in perfect readiness,
the expedition left the harbour without it on the 23rd of
February. The sight, when the fleet got under weigh, was
most imposing; the men-of-war, transports, and store-ships
amounting to one hundred and seventy-five sail.</p>

<p>The British army was composed of the whole or portions of
twenty-seven regiments, exclusive of artillery and pioneers.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
Its total strength in rank and file, including one thousand
sick and five hundred Maltese, was fifteen thousand three
hundred and thirty men. In this number all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">attachés</i> of
the army were reckoned—and consequently the entire force
that could have been combatant in the field would not exceed
twelve thousand bayonets and sabres. This was certainly a
small army with which to attack an enemy in possession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the country, holding fortified posts, with a powerful artillery,
a numerous cavalry, and having a perfect acquaintance with
the only places on the coast where it was practicable to
disembark in safety.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March the Arab’s tower was in sight,—and
next morning the whole fleet entered Aboukir Bay.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> On the
following morning a French frigate was seen running into
Alexandria, having entered the bay in company with the
British fleet.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>The weather was unfavourable for attempting a landing of
the troops. This was a serious disappointment, and an accidental
occurrence added to the inconvenience it would have
otherwise caused. Two engineer officers, engaged in reconnoitring
the coast, advanced too far into the bay through an
over-zealous anxiety to mark out a landing-place. They
were seen and overtaken by a French gun-boat, who fired
into the cutter, killing one of the engineers and making the
other prisoner. The survivor was brought ashore, and forwarded
to Cairo to General Menou; and thus, had the British
descent been before doubtful, this unfortunate discovery
would have confirmed the certainty of an intended landing,
and allowed ample time for preparations being made to oppose
it.</p>

<p>The weather moderated in the morning of the 7th, and the
signal was made by the flag-ship “to prepare for landing.”
But the sea was still so much up that the attempt was postponed,—and
with the exception of an affair between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
boats of the Foudroyant and a party of the enemy, whom they
drove from a block-house, that day passed quietly over.</p>

<p>The 8th was more moderate—the swell had abated—and
preparations for the landing commenced. At two o’clock the
first division were in the boats, amounting to five thousand
five hundred men, under General Coote; while the ships, on
board of which the remainder of the army still remained, were
anchored as near the shore as possible, to allow the landing
brigades their immediate support. The right and left flanks of
the boats were protected by launches and gun-brigs; three
sloops of war, with springs upon their cables, had laid their
broadsides towards the beach; and the Fury and Tartarus
had taken a position to cover the troops with the fire of their
mortars.</p>

<p>The French were drawn up on a ridge of sandhills, with
an elevated hillock in their centre, and twelve pieces of artillery
in position along their line. The moment was one of absorbing
interest—and many a heart beat fast as, in half-companies,
the soldiers stood under arms in the launches, impatiently
waiting for the signal to advance.</p>

<p>A gun was fired; off sprang the boats, while the men-of-war
opened their batteries, and the bomb-vessels commenced
throwing shells. The cannonade from the shipping was
promptly returned by the French lines and Castle of Aboukir;
while on swept the regiments towards the beach, under a
furious discharge of shot and shells, and a torrent of grape and
musketry, that ploughed the surface of the water,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> or carried
death into the dense masses of men crowded in the launches.
But nothing could exceed the glorious rivalry displayed by
both services in advancing: while shot was hailing on the
water, the sailors, as the spray flashed from their oar-blades,
nobly emulated each other in trying who should first beach his
boat. Each cheered the other forward,—while the soldiers
caught the enthusiastic spirit and answered them with loud
huzzas. The beach was gained,—the 23rd and 40th jumped
into the surf, reached the shore, formed as they cleared the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
water, and rushed boldly up the sandhills, never attempting
to draw a trigger, but leaving all to be decided by the bayonet.
The French regiments that confronted them were driven from
the heights; while pressing on, the Nole hills in the rear, with
three pieces of artillery, were captured.</p>

<p>The 42nd were equally successful; they formed with beautiful
regularity in the face of a French battalion protected by two
guns—and after defeating a charge of two hundred cavalry,
stormed and occupied the heights.</p>

<p>While these brilliant attacks had been in progress, the
Guards were charged by the French dragoons in the very act
of landing, and a temporary disorder ensued. The 58th had
formed on the right, and, by a well-directed fire, repulsed the
cavalry with loss. The Guards corrected their line, and instantly
showed front—while the French, unable to shake the
formation of the British, retired behind the sandhills.</p>

<p>The transport boats had been outstripped by those of the
men-of-war—and consequently, the Royals and 54th only
touched the shore as the dragoons rode off. Their landing
was, however, admirably timed; for a French column, under
cover of the sandhills, was advancing with fixed bayonets on
the left flank of the Guards. On perceiving these newly-landed
regiments, its courage failed; it halted, delivered a volley, and
then hastily retreated.</p>

<p>The British had now possession of the heights; the brigade
of Guards was formed and advancing, and the boats returning
to the ships for the remainder of the army. Observing this,
the enemy abandoned their position on the ridge, and, retiring
behind the sandhills in the rear, for some time kept up a scattered
fire. But on the British moving forward they deserted
the ground entirely, leaving three hundred killed and wounded,
eight pieces of cannon, and a number of horses to the victors.
The remainder of the brigades were safely disembarked—Sir
Ralph Abercrombie landed—and a position taken up, the right
upon the sea, and the left on Lake Maadie.</p>

<p>A landing in the face of an enemy, prepared and in position
like the French, under a heavy cannonade, and effected on a
dangerous beach, would naturally occasion a severe loss of life;
and several promising officers, and nearly five hundred men,
were killed, wounded, and missing. The only surprise is, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the casualties were not greater. The mode in which an army
is debarked exposes it unavoidably to fire—and troops, packed
by fifties in a launch, afford a striking mark for an artillerist.
Guns, already in position on the shore, enable those who work
them to obtain the range of an approaching object with great
precision; and the effect of a well-directed shot upon a boat
crowded with troops is necessarily most destructive.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>After the army had been united, it advanced by slow marches,
some trifling skirmishing daily occurring between the advanced
posts. On the 12th, the British bivouac was at the town of
Mandora, and on the 13th Sir Ralph moved forward to attack
the enemy, who were posted on a ridge of heights.</p>

<p>The French, reinforced by two half brigades of infantry, a
regiment of cavalry from Cairo, and a corps from Rosetta,
mustered about five thousand five hundred of that arm, with
five hundred horse, and five-and-twenty pieces of artillery.
Their position was well chosen, as it stood on a bold eminence
having an extensive glacis in its front, which would allow full
sweep for the fire of its numerous and well-appointed artillery.
The English attack was directed against the right wing,—and
in two lines, the brigades advanced in columns of regiments,
the reserve covering the movements, and marching parallel
with the first.</p>

<p>Immediately on debouching from a date-wood, the enemy
descended from the heights, and the 92nd—the leading regiment
on the left—was attacked by a furious discharge of grape
and musketry; while the French cavalry charged down the
hill, and threw themselves upon the 90th, which led the right
column. Though the charge was most gallantly made, Latour
Maubourg leading the dragoons at a gallop, a close and shattering
volley from the 90th obliged them to turn along the
front of the regiment, and retreat with a heavy loss. A few of
the leading files, however, had actually reached the line, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
were bayoneted in a desperate effort to break it. The attempt
failed—and in executing his duty gloriously, their gallant leader
was desperately wounded. The British pushed the reserve
into action on the right; the Guards, in the rear, to support
the centre, and Doyle’s brigade, in column, behind the left.
The French were on every point forced from their position—but,
covered by the fire of their numerous guns and the fusilade
of their voltigeurs, they retreated across the plain, and occupied
their own lines on the heights of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Dillon’s regiment, during this movement, made a brilliant
bayonet charge, captured two guns, and turned them instantly
on the enemy. Wishing to follow up this success, Sir Ralph
attempted to carry the position by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de main</i>; and advancing
across the plain, he directed the brigades of Moore and
Hutchinson to assault the flanks of the French position simultaneously.
To attempt dislodging a force, posted as the enemy
were, could only end in certain discomfiture. The troops could
make no way<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>—a murderous fire of artillery mowed them
down—“the French, no longer in danger, had only to load and
fire; aim was unnecessary, the bullets could not but do their
office, and plunge into the lines.” For several hours the English
remained, suffering this exterminating fire patiently; and
at sunset, the order being given to fall back, the army retired
and took up a position for the night.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
The British loss, its strength considered, was immense.
Eleven hundred men were killed and wounded,—while that of
the enemy amounted barely to a third, with four field-pieces,
which they were obliged to abandon.</p>

<p>A strong position was now taken by Sir Ralph; the right
reached the sea, resting on the ruins of a Roman palace, and
projecting a quarter of a mile over heights in front. This promontory
of sandhills and ruins was some three hundred yards
across, sloping gradually to a valley, which divided it from the
hills which formed the rest of the lines. The extreme left appuied
on two batteries—and Lake Maadie protected the rear—and
the whole, from sea to lake, extended about a mile. In
front of the right, the ground was uneven; but that before the
centre would admit cavalry to act. The whole space had once
been a Roman colony—and, on its ruined site, a hard-fought
day was now about to be decided.</p>

attacks the British lines.—Battle of the 21st.—The English commander
wounded.—Casualties of both armies.—Remarks.—Death of Sir Ralph
Abercrombie.</p></blockquote>

<p>The French position was still stronger than the English lines,
as it stretched along a ridge of lofty hills, extending from the
sea on one side to the canal of Alexandria on the other. A
tongue of land in the advance of their right, ran nearly for a
mile parallel with the canal, and had obliged the British posts
to be thrown considerably back, and thus obliqued their line.
In a classic and military view, nothing could be more imposing
than the ground on which Menou’s army were encamped. In
the centre stood Fort Cretin; on the left, Fort Caffarelli;
Pompey’s Pillar showed boldly on the right; Cleopatra’s
Needle on the left; while Alexandria appeared in the background,
with its walls extending to the sea; and at the extremity
of a long low neck of land, the ancient Pharos was
visible. Wherever the eye ranged, objects of no common interest
met it: some of the “wonders of the world” were contiguous;
and “the very ruins under foot were sacred from their
antiquity.”</p>

<p>The British army had little leisure, and probably as little
inclination, to indulge in classic recollections. The men were
busily engaged in fortifying the position, bringing up guns
for the batteries, and collecting ammunition and stores. The
magazines were inconveniently situated; and to roll weighty
spirit-casks through the deep sands was a most laborious task,
and it principally devolved upon the seamen. The fuel was
particularly bad, the billets being obtained from the date-tree,
which it is almost impossible to ignite, and whose smoke, when
kindling, pains, by its pungency, the eyes of all within its influence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Water was abundant, but of indifferent quality;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
and as Menou, with a most unjustifiable severity, inflicted
death upon the Arabs who should be found bringing sheep to
the camp, the price of fresh provisions was high, and the supply
precarious.</p>

<p>On the 10th, an affair took place between an enemy’s patrol
and a detachment of British cavalry, under Colonel Archdale.
It was a very gallant, but very imprudent encounter—a third
of the men, and half the officers, being killed or taken.
Another casualty occurred also, to the great regret of all.
Colonel Brice, of the Guards, in going his rounds, was deceived
by a mirage; and coming unexpectedly on an enemy’s
post, received a wound of which he died the third day, a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Menou was reported to be advancing; and an Arab chief
apprised Sir Sydney Smith, that the French intended an attack
upon the British camp next morning. The information
was discredited; but the result proved that it was authentic.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March, the army, at three o’clock, as usual,
stood to their arms—and for half an hour all was undisturbed.
Suddenly, a solitary musket was fired, a cannon-shot succeeded
it, and a spattering fusilade, broken momentarily with the
heavier booming of a gun, announced that an attack was being
made. The feebleness of the fire rendered it doubtful against
what point the real effort of the French would be directed.
All looked impatiently for daybreak, which, though faintly
visible in the east, seemed to break more tardily the more its
assistance was desired.</p>

<p>On the right, a noise was heard; all listened in breathless
expectation; shouts and a discharge of musketry succeeded;
the roar increased; momentarily it became louder,—there indeed
the enemy were in force—and there the British line was
seriously assailed.</p>

<p>Favoured by broken ground, and covered by the haze of
morning, the French had partially surprised the videts, attacked
the pickets, and following them quickly, drove them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
back upon the line. One column advanced upon the ruin
field by the 58th, their drums beating the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pas de charge</i>, and
the officers cheering the men forward. Colonel Houston, who
commanded the regiment, fearing lest his own pickets might
have been retiring in front of the enemy’s column, reserved
his fire, until the glazed hats of the French were distinguishable
in the doubtful light. The 58th lined a wall partly dilapidated,
but which in some places afforded them an excellent
breastwork; and the twilight allowed the French column to
be only distinctly seen when within thirty yards of the post.
As the regiment occupied detached portions of the wall, where
its greater ruin exposed it to attack, an irregular but well-sustained
fusilade was kept up, until the enemy’s column, unable
to bear the quick and well-directed musketry of the
British, retired into a hollow for shelter. There they reformed,
and wheeling to the right endeavoured to turn the left
of the redoubt, while another column marched against the
battery occupied by the 28th. On the front attack the regiment
opened a heavy fire—but part of the enemy had gained
the rear, and another body penetrated through the ruined wall.
Thus assailed on every side, the 58th wheeled back two companies,
who, after delivering three effective volleys, rushed
forward with the bayonet. The 23rd now came to support
the 58th—while the 42nd moved round the exterior of the
ruins, cutting off the French retreat; and of the enemy, all
who entered the redoubt were killed or taken.</p>

<p>The situation of the 28th and 58th was, for a time, as extraordinary
as it was dangerous—for at the same moment they
were actually repelling three separate attacks, and were assailed
simultaneously on their front, flanks, and rear.</p>

<p>The 42nd, in relieving the 28th, was exposed to a serious
charge of French cavalry. Nearly unperceived, the dragoons
wheeled suddenly round the left of the redoubt, and though
the ground was full of holes, rode furiously over tents and
baggage, and, charging <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>, completely overthrew the
Highlanders. In this desperate emergency, the 42nd, with
broken ranks, and in that unavoidable confusion which, when
it occurs, renders cavalry so irresistible, fought furiously hand
to hand, and opposed their bayonets fearlessly to the sabres of
the French. The flank companies of the 40th, immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
beside them, dared not, for a time, deliver their fire, the combatants
were so intermingled in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>. At this moment
General Stuart brought up the foreign brigade in beautiful
order, and their heavy and well-sustained fusilade decided the
fate of the day “Nothing could withstand it, and the enemy
fled or perished.”</p>

<p>During this charge of cavalry, Sir Ralph Abercrombie, who
had ridden to the right on finding it seriously engaged, advanced
to the ruins where the contest was raging, after having
despatched his aide-de-camp<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> with orders to the more distant
brigades. He was quite alone; and some French dragoons
having penetrated to the spot, one, remarking that he was a
superior officer, charged and overthrew the veteran commander.
In an attempt to cut him down, the old man, nerved with a
momentary strength, seized the uplifted sword, and wrested it
from his assailant, while a Highland soldier transfixed the
Frenchman with his bayonet. Unconscious that he was
wounded in the thigh, Sir Ralph complained only of a pain in
his breast, occasioned, as he supposed, by a blow from the
pommel of the sword during his recent struggle with the dragoon.
The first officer that came up was Sir Sydney Smith, who,
having broken the blade of his sabre, received from Sir
Ralph the weapon of which he had despoiled the French
hussar.</p>

<p>The cavalry being completely repulsed, Sir Ralph walked
firmly to the redoubt on the right of the Guards, from which
a commanding view of the entire battle-field could be obtained.
The French, though driven from the camp, still maintained the
battle on the right, and charging with their reserve cavalry,
attacked the foreign brigade. Here, too, they were resolutely
repulsed; and their infantry, finding their efforts everywhere
unsuccessful, changed their formation and acted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en tirailleur</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>,
with the exception of one battalion, which still held a flèche<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
in front of the redoubt, on either flank of which the Republican
colours were planted.</p>

<p>At this time the ammunition of the British was totally exhausted;
some regiments, particularly the reserve, had not a
single cartridge; and in the battery the supply for the guns was
reduced to a single round. In consequence, the British fire on
the right had nearly ceased, but in the centre the engagement
still continued.</p>

<p>There the attack had commenced at daybreak; a column of
grenadiers, supported by a heavy line of infantry, furiously
assailing the Guards, and driving in the flankers which had
been thrown out to check their advance. Observing the
echelon<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> formation of the British, the French general instantly
attempted to turn their left; but the officer commanding on
that flank as promptly prevented it, by throwing some companies
sharply back, while Coote’s brigade having come up, and
opening its musketry, obliged the enemy to give way and
retire. Finding the attack in column fail, the French broke
into extended order and opened a scattered fusilade, while
every gun that could be brought to bear by their artillery was
turned on the English position. But all was vain; though suffering
heavily from this murderous fire, the formation of the
Guards was coolly corrected when disturbed by the cannonade—while
the fine and imposing attitude of these regiments removed
all hope that they could be shaken, and prevented any
renewal of attack.</p>

<p>The British left had never been seriously attempted, consequently
its casualties were very few, and occasioned by a
distant fire from the French guns, and a trifling interchange
of musketry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
While the British right was, from want of ammunition,
nearly <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, the French approached the redoubt
once more. They, too, had expended their cartridges—and
both the assailants and assailed actually pelted the other with
stones,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> of which missiles there was a very abundant supply
upon the ground. A sergeant of the 28th had his skull beaten
in by a blow, and died upon the spot. The grenadiers of the
40th, however, not relishing this novel mode of attack and
defence, moved out to end the business with the bayonet.
Instantly the assailants ran—the sharpshooters abandoned the
hollows—and the battalion, following their example, evacuated
the flèche, leaving the battle-ground in front unoccupied by any
save the dead and dying.</p>

<p>Menou’s attempts had all been signally defeated. He perceived
that the British lines had sustained no impression that
would justify a continuation of the attack, and he determined
to retreat. His brigades accordingly moved off under the
heights of their position in excellent order; and though, for
a considerable distance, they were forced to retire within an
easy range of cannon-shot, the total want of ammunition
obliged the English batteries to remain silent, and permit the
French march to be effected with trifling molestation. The
cannon on the British left, and the guns of some men-of-war
cutters, which had anchored close in with the land upon the
right, kept up a galling fire, their shots plunging frequently
into the French ranks, and particularly into those of a
corps of cavalry posted on a bridge over the canal of Alexandria,
to observe any movement the British left might
threaten.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the action had ended. Sir Ralph Abercrombie
previously refused to quit the field, and remained exposed to
the heavy cannonade directed on the battery where he stood,
until perfectly assured that the French defeat had been decisive.
From what proved a fatal wound he appeared at first to
feel but little inconvenience, complaining only of the contusion
on his breast.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> When, however, the day was won, and exertion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
no longer necessary, nature yielded, and in an exhausted
state he was carried in a hammock off the field, accompanied
by the tears and blessings of the soldiery. In the evening he
was removed, for better care, on board the flag-ship, where he
continued until his death.</p>

<p>Immediate attention was bestowed upon the wounded, who,
from the confined nature of the ground on which the grand
struggles of the day had occurred, were lying in fearful numbers
all around. Many of the sufferers had been wounded by grape-shot,
others mangled by the sabres, or trodden down by the
horses of the cavalry. Death had been busily employed. Of
the British, two hundred and forty were dead, including six
officers; eleven hundred and ninety men and sixty officers
wounded; and thirty privates and three officers missing.
Other casualties had occurred. The tents had been shred to
pieces by the French guns, and many of the wounded and sick,
who were lying there, were killed. No wonder could be expressed
that the loss of life had been so terrible, for thousands
of brass cannon-balls were lying loosely about, and glistening
on the sands.</p>

<p>The French loss had been most severe. One thousand and
fifty bodies were buried<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> on the field of battle, and nearly seven
hundred wounded were found mingled with the dead. The
total loss sustained by Menou’s army could not have been much
under four thousand; and in this the greater portion of his
principal officers must be included. General Roiz was found
dead in the rear of the redoubt, and the French order of battle
discovered in his pocket. Near the same place two guns had
been abandoned,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and these, with a stand of colours, fell, as
trophies of their victory, to the conquerors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
No army could have behaved more gallantly than the
British. Surrounded, partially broken, and even without a
cartridge left, the contest was continued and a victory won.
That the French fought bravely, that their attacks were vigorously
made, and, after discomfiture, as boldly repeated, must
be admitted; and that, in becoming the assailant, Menou conferred
an immense advantage on the British, is equally true.
There Menou betrayed want of judgment; for had he but
waited forty-eight hours the British must have attacked him.
Indeed, the assault was already planned; and, as it was to
have been made in the night, considering the strength of their
position, and the fine <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of the Republican troops, a
more precarious trial could never have been hazarded. But
the case was desperate; the successes of the 8th and 13th,—and
dearly bought, though gloriously achieved, they were,—must
have been rendered nugatory, unless forward operations
could have been continued. In short, Menou fought Abercrombie’s
battle—and he who must have been assailed, became
himself the assailant.</p>

<p>Military criticism, like political disquisitions, come not
within the design of a work merely intended to describe the
action of the battle, or the immediate events that preceded or
resulted; but, if the truth were told, during these brief operations,
from the landing to the evening of the 21st, mistakes
were made on both sides. The military character of Britain
had been sadly lowered by mismanagement at home, and still
more ridiculously undervalued abroad,—and it remained for
future fields and a future conqueror to re-establish for England
a reputation in arms, and prove that the island-spirit wanted
only a field for its display.</p>

<p>After lingering a few days, the French Generals Lannuse
and Bodet died of their wounds; and on the evening of the
28th, the British army had to lament the decease of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
gallant and beloved commander. An attempt to extract the
ball, attended with great pain, was unsuccessful. Mortification
ensued, Sir Ralph sank rapidly, and while his country and his
army engrossed his every thought, he expired, full of years and
honour, universally and most justly lamented.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>The eulogy of his successor in command thus concludes:
“Were it permitted for a soldier to regret any one who has
fallen in the service of his country, I might be excused for lamenting
him more than any other person; but it is some consolation
to those who tenderly loved him, that as his life was
honourable so was his death glorious. His memory will be
recorded in the annals of his country, will be sacred to every
British soldier, and embalmed in the recollection of a grateful
posterity.”</p>

<p>In 1805, the British Government, having ascertained that the
Cape of Good Hope had only a force under two thousand
regular troops for its protection, and that the militia and inhabitants
were well-inclined to assist an English army, in case
a landing should be made, determined to attempt the reduction
of that colony, by the employment of a body of troops cantoned
in the neighbourhood of Cork, assisted by some regiments
already on board the India ships at Falmouth.</p>

<p>The expedition was to be a secret one—and the troops embarked
at Cork were ostensibly intended for service in the
Mediterranean. It was supposed that this report would prevent
suspicion, particularly as the Company’s fleet sailed alone,
as if its destination was really Madras direct. Sealed orders
were, however, given to the commanders to be opened in a
certain latitude,—and in these they were ordered to rendezvous
at Madeira.</p>

<p>The troops composing the expedition were placed under the
command of General Baird. They comprised the 24th, 38th,
59th, 71st, 72nd, 83rd, and 98th, part of the 20th light dragoons,
with artillery, artificers, and recruits, making a total
force of six thousand six hundred and fifty rank and file.</p>

<p>It was at first suspected that some troops which had left
Rochfort in two line-of-battle ships, and escaped the vigilance
of our cruisers, might have been intended to reinforce the
garrison at the Cape, and General Baird conceived the corps
intrusted to him not sufficiently strong to achieve the objects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of the expedition. He asked, under this impression, for an
additional force, and stated the grounds on which the request
was made; but, in the mean time, it was ascertained that the
French troops had proceeded to the West Indies; and that,
therefore, the Cape of Good Hope had received no increase to
its military establishment.</p>

<p>After another application to obtain an increase to the corps
already under his orders, by having the 8th regiment added to
the force, the expedition sailed, stopping at Madeira and St.
Salvador to obtain water and provisions. Nothing of moment
occurred in the voyage to South America; the passage was
tedious, and an Indiaman and transport ran on a low sandy
island, called the Roccas, and were totally lost. Fortunately,
the men on board and twelve chests of dollars were saved from
the wreck. Only three individuals perished;—of these, General
Yorke, in command of the artillery, was one, and Major
Spicer, the next in seniority, succeeded him. While staying
at St. Salvador, the regiments were landed and inspected, a
remount of fifty horses obtained for the cavalry, and, all arrangements
being completed, the expedition sailed for its final
destination on the 28th of November, and made the African
coast, a little to the northward of the Cape, on the 4th of
January, 1806.</p>

<p>“Table Bay, on the shore, and almost in the centre of which
Cape Town stands, receives its name from that extraordinary
eminence called Table Mountain, which rises about three thousand
six hundred and eighty-seven feet above the level of the
sea, and which terminates in a perfectly flat surface at that
height, where the face of the rock on the side of Cape Town
descends almost perpendicularly. To the eastward of the
mountain, separated from it by a chasm, is Charles’s Mount,
more generally called the Devil’s Tower; and on the westward,
a round hill rises on the right hand of the bay, called the Lion’s
Head, from which a ridge of high land, terminating in another
smaller hill, called the Lion’s Rump, stretches towards the
sea.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>The town itself is handsome and extensive; and the streets,
intersecting each other at right angles, are broad and airy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
generally built with stone, and with terraces in front. The
Company’s gardens, walks, parade, and castle, all add to the
beauty of the place, and render it superior to any colonial city
in the possession of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The coast is everywhere dangerous—landing, excepting in
the bays, and that, too, in favourable weather, almost impracticable—and
hence, a very inferior force on shore, if the surf
were at all up, might successfully resist any attempt at the disembarkation
of an army.</p>

<p>The troops in garrison consisted of a detachment of Batavian
artillery, the 22nd Dutch regiment of the line, a German regiment
of Waldecks, and a native corps, which acted as light
infantry. To these, an auxiliary battalion, formed from the
seamen and marines of a frigate and corvette which had been
wrecked upon the coast, were added; while a number of irregulars,
mounted and dismounted, comprised of the boors, and
armed with guns of enormous length of barrel, completed the
force of General Janssens, who was then commandant at the
Cape.</p>

<p>The governor had a high reputation, both as a soldier and a
civilian, and from the excellence of his measures since his
arrival at the Cape, was held most deservedly in great estimation
by the colonists. On the appearance of the British fleet,
although his numerical superiority was greater than that of his
enemy, he wisely considered that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of the invaders
was far more efficient than his own; and leaving a garrison in
Cape Town, he determined to fall back on the interior with
the remainder of his troops, and carry on a desultory war, until
the arrival of a French or Dutch fleet from Europe should
enable him to resort to active measures and save the colony.
This plan, though ruinous to the inhabitants if carried out,
would have rendered the subjugation of the Cape a very difficult
and tedious undertaking for the British—and in this
posture of affairs the expedition made the coast, and came to
anchor on the evening of the 4th, just out of range of the batteries
in Table Bay.</p>

<p>The weather was fortunately calm, but the day was too far
advanced to admit a landing of the troops—but all was prepared
for effecting it on the morrow. The coast was sounded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the approaches to the town reconnoitred, and a small inlet, sixteen
miles north-east of the town, called Leopard’s Bay, was
selected as the point on which the troops should be disembarked.
The transports accordingly weighed and took their
stations, while the men-of-war got into a position to cover the
landing, in case of opposition, with their guns.</p>

<p>During the night the surf had risen so prodigiously, that at
daylight it was declared unsafe for boats to attempt the beach,
and a landing at Saldana Bay was proposed. There it could
be easily effected, but it would carry the army a distance from
the town, separate it on its march from the fleet, oblige it to
depend for its supplies on what provisions it could carry, or
any which by accidental circumstances it could obtain on its
route: it would also entail a harassing march of seventy miles
on soldiers so long cooped up on shipboard; and that, too, in
the hot season of the year, over a heavy sand, where water was
not procurable.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Still, the uncertainty of the weather, and the
necessity of an immediate attack, overcame all other objections;
and on the evening of the 5th, General Beresford, with the
38th regiment and the 20th light dragoons, sailed for Saldana,
with an understanding, that the remainder of the army should
proceed thither on the following morning.</p>

<p>But daylight on the 6th broke with happier promise; the
surf had gone down considerably; and it was at once decided
that the troops should be landed without farther loss of time.
The Highland brigade was instantly transferred from the
transports to the boats, and the 71st, 72nd, and 93rd, effected
a landing with but a single casualty, and that arising from the
swamping of a launch, by which five-and-thirty Highlanders
were drowned.</p>

<p>No other loss attended the operation—the light company of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the 93rd cleared the brushwood of a few skirmishers that had
been thrown out by the enemy—and the remainder of the
troops debarked without any opposition.</p>

<p>The artillery, consisting of four six-pounders and a couple of
howitzers, were landed on the 7th; and the whole of the force
being now safely on shore, the British general commenced his
march direct on Cape Town, the guns being dragged through
the sands by fatigue parties furnished from the fleet.</p>

<p>The advance was unopposed until the English army had approached
a line of heights, some four miles distant from the
landing place. The Blawberg, as one of these eminences is
called, was occupied by burgher cavalry—and the videts announced
that General Janssens was in position on the other
side of the high grounds, and his whole disposable force drawn
up in order of battle. The march was steadily continued, and
when the Blawberg was crowned by the advanced guard, the
Batavian army, formed in two lines, with twenty-five pieces of
artillery and a large corps of irregular cavalry, was discovered.</p>

<p>General Baird formed his corps into two columns of brigades;
the right, comprising the 24th, 59th, and 83rd, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Baird, commanding in the absence of General
Beresford; and the left, consisting of the Highland regiments,
under General Fergusson. While deploying into line, the
Batavian guns opened, and their cavalry, by a left extension,
threatened the right of the British. Baird’s brigade refused
its right, checking the burgher horse with its musketry; and
the Highland regiments on the left made a rapid movement
under a heavy cannonade, and advanced to the charge. The
right wing of the Batavian army broke without waiting an assault—the
left followed the example—and the field was totally
abandoned by the enemy, with a considerable loss in killed
and wounded.</p>

<p>Without cavalry it was impossible to complete the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i>.
The guns were, therefore, carried off; and quitting the road
to Cape Town, Janssens, in pursuance of his previous plan,
marched eastward, and moved towards Hottentot Holland, with
a hope of protracting a war in the interior. Of course the
capital was the object of the conqueror. The fleet was in an
exposed anchorage—and to equip his army for ulterior operations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
and secure his communication with the sea, it was necessary
to possess Cape Town.</p>

<p>The advance was very distressing, and the troops suffered
much. The badness of the roads, the heat of the weather, and
worse still, the scarcity of water, was severely felt before the
brigades, at a late hour, reached their bivouacs in Reit Valley,
a farming establishment belonging to the Dutch government.
Here some salt provisions, which had been floated through the
surf, were brought up by the marines, and partitioned among
the soldiers; while the few and scanty springs attached to the
farm afforded them an indifferent supply of water. An immediate
movement on the capital was imperative; and the
next day the British reached a position beside the Salt River—an
inlet some short distance from the strong lines which
cover Cape Town.</p>

<p>These defences are formed of a chain of redoubts, with a
connecting parapet, furnished with banquettes<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and a dry-ditch.
They extend about eight hundred yards, and unite the
Devil’s Berg with the sea. These lines were very formidable,
as they had been considerably strengthened by the English
during their possession of the colony. One hundred and fifty
guns and howitzers were mounted on the works; and several
batteries had been erected on the escarpe of the mountain, that
would have exposed assailing troops to a flanking fire, and, in
storming the lines, occasioned a severe loss of life. One battery
and blockhouse were placed on a shoulder of the hill,
thirteen hundred feet above the level of the plain. But this
was probably the least effective of the defences; as, in modern
warfare, a plunging fire is not regarded much. A mile behind
the lines the castle of Good Hope is situated at the entrance
of the town. It is a pentagon, with outworks strong
enough to require a regular approach; and that side of the
city which overlooks the bay is secured alike by the fire of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
castle, and a number of batteries mounted with guns of heavy
calibre.</p>

<p>To carry works so extensive, and so formidable in their defences,
with a small corps like Baird’s, unprovided with any
artillery but the light field-pieces they had brought through
the sands, was not to be attempted; and it was determined to
obtain some heavy guns, and a reinforcement of seamen and
marines from the fleet. But these were not required: the
enemy sent out a flag of truce, and an armistice was agreed
upon, which terminated ultimately in a capitulation. The
town and its defences were given up to the British army,
and, without a shot, works were surrendered to a force of
not four thousand men, on which were mounted four hundred
and fifty-six guns and mortars, most of them of the heaviest
calibre.</p>

<p>Janssens, after his defeat, retired towards the interior; and
having disbanded the militia and burgher cavalry, which had
accompanied him, he took a position at Kloof, with twelve
hundred regular troops, and some five-and-twenty guns.
General Baird, anxious to effect the tranquillity of the colony
and terminate hostilities at once, despatched General Beresford
to make overtures to the Dutch governor, and induce him to
capitulate. A long and doubtful negotiation took place between
the British and Batavian commanders, which eventually
ended in the whole of the colony of the Cape of Good Hope
and its dependencies, with all the rights and privileges held
and exercised by the Dutch government, being formally transferred
to his Britannic Majesty.</p>

<p>Although the capture of the Cape was effected with trifling
loss, and the opposition given to the British troops was far less
formidable than might have been anticipated, still the operations
which were so deservedly crowned with success, were
boldly planned and bravely executed. Janssens exhibited no
military talent,—and in a country abounding in strong positions,
to offer battle in an open plain, and oppose an irregular
force to a well-disciplined army, was a strange decision of the
Batavian commander, and could only terminate in defeat. In
an engagement in which the Dutch army was so easily routed,
and the ulterior operations which followed, there was nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
of that brilliancy which marked other victories achieved by
British bravery—but no conquest was attended with more advantages
and permanent results. A noble colony was obtained
for Great Britain with little loss of life—and the only portion
of Africa worth her occupation was secured to the “Mistress
of the Seas.”</p>

<p>It has been remarked with great justice, that until the Peninsular
war had been for some time in progress, the military
enterprises of Great Britain invariably failed from the blind
policy of those who planned them. Instead of condensing the
power of the empire into one grand and sustained effort, its
strength was frittered away in paltry and unprofitable expeditions.
An army, imposing in its full integrity, if subdivided
into corps, and employed on detached services, and in different
countries, can achieve nothing beyond a partial success—for
soon after its divided brigades are landed on their scenes of action,
their weakness produces their discomfiture, and they retire
necessarily before a superior force. In the first moment of disembarkation
it may create a temporary alarm; but beyond
this no object can be gained, and the result ends in an idle
demonstration.</p>

<p>Political details are generally unconnected with the actual
occurrences on the battle-field; and it will be enough to
remark, that Sicily should have at this period commanded
more attention from England than she did. Naturally defensible,
with a well-affected population of nearly a million and a
half, she had been taught to place but little reliance on her
allies. One British corps held Messina,—but a French force
was moving to the extremity of Calabria, avowedly to drive
it from the island. Though well-affected, the Sicilians were
distrustful; they feared that they should be abandoned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
vengeance of those troops who had already overrun Naples,—and
they believed that the British regiment waited only until
the French army should make its descent, when they would
embark for Malta, and leave the Sicilians to their fate.</p>

<p>At this time, Sir John Stuart succeeded Sir James Craig, a
man best described by terming him an “old-school commander.”
Under him the army had been totally inactive:
and eight thousand excellent troops were permitted to occupy
their quarters idly, when so much depended upon a bold, even
though not a very fortunate, display of energy in the British.
Stuart at once perceived the mischievous consequences this indolence
of his predecessor had occasioned; and he determined
by active operations to redeem the British army from the apathetic
character it had too justly obtained among the Sicilian
people.</p>

<p>The British corps, amounting to eight thousand men, was
concentrated at Messina. In Calabria the French were considerably
detached; and though numerically stronger, with
three thousand in the South, four thousand in Upper Calabria,
and the remainder occupying numerous posts, it was quite practicable
to take them in detail, effect a landing between the two
corps, engage them separately, and clear the country from St.
Euphemia to the Castle of Scylla. To insure success, despatch
and secrecy were required. The first rested with Stuart, and
every arrangement necessary on his part was effected; the
latter depended on the Sicilian court, and by it the secrecy of
the intended expedition was undoubtedly betrayed.</p>

<p>On the 28th of June, at Melazzo, the embarkation of five
thousand men was quietly accomplished—and on the third
morning they landed on the beach of St. Euphemia. During
the 2nd and 3rd stores and supplies were disembarked; and
moving forward, on that evening the pickets of the rival armies
confronted each other. The enemy’s force was at first supposed
to be merely the division of Upper Calabria; but that
of the South had formed a junction; and Reynier had now
seven thousand infantry, and a few troops of cavalry amounting
to three hundred and fifty sabres.</p>

<p>The British in numbers were greatly inferior. Five thousand
infantry, six six-pounders and eight mountain guns,
formed their whole strength. Reynier was also in position—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
his army being posted on some heights which overlooked the
march of the British as they moved through a low country, at
first partially wooded, but opening into a spacious plain, and
of course permitting their numbers and dispositions to be correctly
ascertained by their enemy during the advance.</p>

<p>This, as the result proved, was an unfortunate advantage
for the French General. Whether reckoning too much on his
opponent’s inferiority of force, or undervaluing the character
of his soldiers, Reynier, supposing that Stuart, having advanced
in error, would retire on discovering his mistake, abandoned
the heights, passed a river in his front, and offered
battle on the plain. As his columns approached, General Stuart
at once perceived, from the ground they covered, that Reynier’s
force was much larger than he had expected, and that
he had united his detached brigades; but, with the just confidence
of a British leader he trusted to the bravery of his
troops; and in that safe reliance boldly stood “the hazard of
the die.”</p>

<p>The battle commenced about nine o’clock—and there was
no manœuvring on either side. The ground was level, and
both armies, under cover of their light troops, advanced steadily
and deployed into line. The enemy’s left was composed
of voltigeurs, and the right of the British that opposed them
(Kempt’s brigade) was formed of a light infantry battalion and
the Corsician Rangers. After an interchange of three volleys,
the French were ordered to advance—at the same time the
British lowered their bayonets, and both pressed boldly forward.
The front ranks were now within six paces of each other—the
French advancing, cheered by the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">En avant, mes enfans!</i>”
of their officers. The British needed no encouragement—on
they came, with that imposing steadiness which told what the
result must be, when bayonets crossed, and “steel met steel.”
The voltigeurs had not firmness to abide the shock; they broke
and turned, but too late for flight to save them. Their front
rank was bayonetted and trodden down—while the rear endeavoured
to escape by a disorderly rush from the field, exposed
to severe loss from the British artillery.</p>

<p>Kempt’s gallant and successful charge was ably seconded by
Ackland’s brigade, which held the right centre. They advanced
against the demi-brigade opposed to them, forced it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
back across the Amato, and never allowed the routed wing one
moment to rally. The pursuit was so ardently continued, that
for a mile the French were followed by the victors, suffering
heavily in killed and wounded, and losing a number of prisoners.</p>

<p>This success, though brilliant, was far from being decisive.
The ardour of the right wing had carried it away, leaving
the left totally unsupported, and open to Reynier’s undivided
efforts. From the superiority of his force, he showed a larger
front, and availing himself of this advantage, endeavoured to
turn the British left—and in this attempt his cavalry had
nearly succeeded. After a feint upon the centre, they
wheeled sharply to the right making a flank movement,
while their infantry threatened the English line with a
charge. This was the crisis of the action. The French
advanced,—Stuart refusing his flank, and obliqueing his line
from the centre. Reynier’s cavalry were about to charge,
when, fortunately, the 20th regiment, under Colonel Ross,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
which had landed after the march of the army, came up.
The attack was already made, the cavalry advancing, when
Ross, under cover of some underwood, deployed in double-quick.
Within a short distance, a close and murderous
volley was thrown in, and the cavalry completely broken.
The British line cheered and moved forward, the French
gave way, and a complete <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i> succeeded. No victory,
considering the numbers opposed, could have been more decisive.
Seven hundred killed, a thousand prisoners, and a
large proportion of wounded, were the estimated loss of the
enemy—while this was achieved by an amount of casualties
greatly disproportioned, the victors having but one officer and
forty-four men killed, and eleven officers and two hundred
and seventy-one men wounded.</p>

<p>For that night the British army bivouacked on the battle-ground—and
having received supplies from the shipping,
advanced on the 6th to overtake the enemy’s rear; while a
brigade under Colonel Oswald marched on the French depôt
at Montelione, of which it took possession, making six hundred
prisoners. The whole of the commissariat stores, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the entire baggage, and the military chest, were captured;
and the remnant of the French army was saved only by
abandoning arms and accoutrements, and retiring with all the
confusion attendant upon a signal defeat.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the enthusiasm with which the victors
were received. The defended places along the coast, turned
on the land side by the army, of course surrendered unconditionally.
The whole of the Peninsula was rapidly crossed,
and on the 11th of July, the leading British brigade invested
the Castle of Scylla.</p>

<p>This place, so deeply associated with ancient recollections,
stands on a sheer rock, commanding the eastern point of the
entrance of the Straits of Messina. The difficulties experienced
by navigators occasionally in this confined channel,
almost realize the old-world legends of its dangers. Once
caught in the currents, when passing Cape Pelorus with light
or contrary winds, a vessel must run for the anchorage, which
lies directly beneath the batteries of the castle; and hence the
possession of the place, especially to a maritime nation, was an
object of paramount importance.</p>

<p>For some days the efforts of the English were confined to
firing on the castle with the field guns. Of course, artillery of a
light calibre could effect nothing but annoyance; until, on the
19th, when some heavy cannon were obtained from Messina.
On the 21st they were placed in battery and opened with
great effect; and on the same evening, as the guns were
breaching rapidly, the commandant accepted terms, and surrendered
the castle to the besiegers.</p>

<p>Until circumstances, unnecessary to detail here, induced
the British army to abandon Calabria, Scylla was strengthened
and maintained. The Calabrese were now in open insurrection—and
a force, dangerous and dreaded by the French as
the Spanish guerillas were afterwards, sprang up among the
mountains of the upper province, and occasioned the invading
army, under Massena, constant alarm, and sometimes a serious
loss.</p>

<p>In a neglected country like Calabria, crime and violence
were fostered by the total want of a police, and the difficulties
which interposed in bringing offenders to justice. The mountains
afforded a secure asylum to delinquents; there they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
retired when pursued, and there occasionally, uniting into
bodies of considerable strength, by a sudden descent upon the
low country, they interrupted the French communications,
endangered their detached posts, and became at last so troublesome,
as to require Murat’s most strenuous exertions, before
their outrages could be repressed, and their leaders exterminated.
To an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élève</i>, who from an aid-de-camp had been
raised to the rank of general, the task was intrusted; and
Manhes, it would appear, executed his orders with firmness
and ability.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Though deserted by the allies on whom they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
had so strongly depended, the Calabrese, after the British had
left their peninsula for Sicily, kept up a desultory contest;
and, for a considerable time, “neither excessive severity of
punishment, burning their villages, destroying their possessions,
nor promises of amnesty, brought them to submit to
Joseph’s government.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Gaeta, though second only to Gibraltar as a place of natural
strength, after a weak defence, surrendered to the French.
The Prince of Hesse Philipstal, who had been appointed
governor, was, in the unhappy spirit of these times, intrusted
with a command for which he was totally unsuited. He
threw away his ammunition and ruined his artillery by a too
early and ineffectual fire, himself standing for hours on the
batteries performing the duty of a bombardier, and estimating
the merit of his defence, rather by the number of rounds discharged
from his guns, than their effect upon the besiegers.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The Castle of Scylla was very differently defended. As a
point of communication with the Calabrese, the British General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
had determined to hold it to the last,—and such were the instructions
given to Colonel Robertson, and the orders were
admirably fulfilled. As the fortress, seaward, was open to the
fleet, a flight of steps was cut in the rock to the water’s edge,
and this outlet to the sea was not visible from any ground
occupied by the enemy. When Scylla was literally reduced to
a heap of ruins, and the French in the very act of entering a
breach so extensively ruined as to be totally indefensible, the
garrison, during a lull in a gale that had been blowing for two
preceding days, were cleverly brought off.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th, Colonel Robertson announced
by telegraph to Sir Sydney Smith that the works were nearly
destroyed, and his guns dismounted or disabled. When the
gale moderated on the 19th, the Admiral instantly gave orders
to rescue the soldiers,—and the men-of-war boats pulled right
across the bay under a tremendous fire, and relieved the brave
garrison with a loss comparatively trifling. The French were
actually in the fort, their batteries maintaining a sweeping fire
of grape-shot and shells, and yet in this bold and successful
effort, the united casualties of both services did not amount to
more than twenty men.</p>

<p>Although military achievements, on a minor scale, have
been eclipsed by the more brilliant conquests obtained by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
British armies in subsequent campaigns, still Maida was not
only a glorious, but, in its results, a most important victory.
Independently of humbling a presumptuous enemy, raising the
depressed reputation of the British army, and converting the
distrusting population of Sicily into grateful admirers,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> the
positive results of Sir John Stuart’s expedition were the
destruction of all the military and naval resources of Calabria,
and the occupation of a post which for eighteen months
secured the navigation of the Straits of Messina, and, in
a great degree, occasioned the meditated descent on Sicily to
fail.</p>

<span class="subhead">BATTLE OF ROLICA.</span>
</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p>British troops sent to the Continent.—Failure of the expedition to Gottenburgh.—State
of Portugal.—An army despatched to assist in its deliverance.—Lands
in Mondego bay.—Advance of the British.—Movements
of the French.—Village of Rolica.—Battle.—Anecdotes and
death of Colonel Lake.—Arrival of reinforcements.</p></blockquote>

<p>The employment of a British army to assist in the liberation of
Portugal appears only to have been decided upon, after the
wildest design which ever crossed the imagination of a blundering
statesman, had been found too absurd even to admit of
an experimental trial. It had been considered advisable to
turn a military force against the over-weening influence of
Napoleon on the Continent; and an army of ten thousand men,
under the command of Sir John Moore, was accordingly
despatched, in May, 1808, to assist Sweden in defending herself
against the united powers of Russia, France, and Denmark.
On reaching Gottenburgh, the British regiments were not even
permitted to debark; but men and horses, after a tedious
voyage, were left by their inhospitable ally “tossing in the
anchorage.” Though reduced to a pitiable state of weakness,
the Swedish monarch was actually dreaming of conquest; and,
a power politically impotent, demanded of those despatched to
assist in his defence, that they should join him in aggression.
A descent on the island of Zealand, in face of armed fortresses
and a superior force, was first propounded, and, of course,
rejected. “It was next proposed that the British alone should
land in Russian Finland, storm a fortress, and take a position
there.” This notion was still more preposterous than the
former; and Sir John Moore endeavoured to prove that “ten
thousand British soldiers were insufficient to encounter the
undivided force of the Russian empire, which could be quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
brought against them, at a point so near St. Petersburgh.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
Some other projects, equally impracticable, were declined—and
this ill-advised expedition ended as might have been expected.
After being exposed to the indignity of an arrest, the
British general returned to England with his army, “leaving
Sweden,” in Napoleon’s words, “to fulfil her destinies.”</p>

<p>Spain had in the mean time been overrun by the French
armies,—the capital was occupied, the dynasty changed, and
the kingdom prostrate at the feet of Napoleon. Yet in this
gloomy hour, when trodden to the earth, the national spirit
remained unbroken—and the flame of popular discontent was
not quenched, but smouldering. Cruelty and oppression had
roused the Spaniards into action—a desultory war raged in
several provinces—and every day it became more formidable
and fierce.</p>

<p>Nor was this hostility to foreign domination confined to
Spain; it had spread itself to Portugal, and Junot’s arbitrary
measures roused a spirit of resistance that wanted but an opportunity
to display itself. A recurrence to terrorism by the
French lieutenant only provoked retaliation. Oporto revolted,
and deforced the garrison—a rising in the north, and the
establishment of a provisional government succeeded—while,
simultaneously, the insurrection broke out in the opposite extremity
of the kingdom; and the French, after an unsuccessful
attempt to suppress it, were driven from Algarve.</p>

<p>Junot, at first, endeavoured to conciliate and gain time,
should no other object be achieved—but the Portuguese saw
clearly his designs, and would no longer permit themselves to
be deluded by the hollow professions of one, whom they justly
looked upon as the enslaver of their country. Risings became
general; and to repress this spirit of insubordination, the
French resorted to severity. It was decreed, that resistance
to the troops should be punished by the destruction of the town
or village where it occurred; and that individuals taken in
arms should be shot, their property pillaged, and their houses
levelled to the earth. These were no idle threats—on the
contrary, they were carried into ferocious execution. Leyria
was destroyed by Margaron—and Loison’s treatment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
inhabitants of Evora and Guardo is indelibly branded on the
revengeful memories of the Portuguese. These towns were
razed and plundered, numbers of their citizens and priests put
to the sword, the women violated, and to neither sex nor age
was mercy extended. To crown the whole, excessive contributions
were laid upon an impoverished people—and inability
to pay made a pretext for spoliation. Could it then be wondered
at that a terrible reaction ensued—that the country
should be overrun by guerillas<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>—and that vengeance, when it
could be obtained, was most unmercifully exacted?</p>

<p>At this momentous period, England determined to make an
effort in the cause of freedom, and come to the assistance of the
oppressed. Although crippled by the number of irregular bands
that were swarming over Alentejo, Junot held the fortresses of
Almeida, Elvas, and Peniche, which, with the minor posts in
their possession, gave the French a hold upon the country from
which it would be difficult to drive them.</p>

<p>The force destined for the relief of Portugal was sent partly
from Ireland, and partly from Gibraltar. Nine thousand men
from Cork, under Sir Arthur Wellesley, landed in Mondego
bay on the 6th of August—and these were joined, two days
afterwards, by Spencer’s division of five thousand—making
thus a total force of about fourteen thousand, in which two
hundred of the 20th light dragoons and eighteen pieces of artillery
were included.</p>

<p>A combined movement with a Portuguese corps under Bernardine
Friere having been arranged, it was determined to
move at once upon the capital; and on the morning of the 9th
the British advanced guard, consisting of a part of the 60th
and 95th rifles, commenced its march, supported by the brigades
of Generals Hill and Ferguson. On the next day the remainder
of the army followed—the men provided with sixty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
rounds of cartridges, provisions for three days, and attended by
a number of mules, loaded with stores of various descriptions.
“No troops ever took the field in higher spirits, or in a state
of more perfect discipline. Confident in their leader likewise,
and no less confident in themselves, they desired nothing more
ardently than to behold their enemy.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>On the 12th, Friere’s corps joined at Leiria, but, under different
pretexts, the Portuguese commander declined co-operating
as he had promised, and limited his assistance to one weak
brigade of infantry and two hundred and fifty horse. Undaunted
by this early disclosure of imbecility and bad faith, Sir
Arthur determined to push on, and endeavour to engage the
Duke of Abrantes before he could unite himself with Loison.</p>

<p>On receiving intelligence of the descent of the English,
Junot, adding the brigade of Thomieres to that of Delaborde,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
despatched the latter towards Mondego, to observe the enemy
closely, and use every means to retard their advance. Delaborde,
accordingly moving to the coast, found himself on the
eve of an affair with the British—and he fell back leisurely as
they advanced. His rear-guard quitted Caldas the evening
before Sir Arthur entered it; and on the following morning,
and for the first time on the Peninsula, the rival armies of
France and England found themselves in each other’s presence.</p>

<p>On the 15th, a trifling affair of outposts produced a few
casualties,—and on the 16th, Delaborde’s position was reconnoitred
and dispositions made to attack it.</p>

<p>This, in a European command, was to be Wellington’s maiden
field. In the numbers engaged, Rolica bore no proportion to
the masses combatant in future battles—but it was a well-contested
and sanguinary encounter—and worthy to be the name
first engraven on the long scroll of victories of which it gave
such glorious promise.</p>

<p>The French position, in natural strength and romantic
beauty, was unequalled; and when Delaborde had made up
his mind to risk a battle, he displayed consummate judgment
in selecting the ground on which the trial of strength should
be decided.</p>

<p>The villages of Rolica and Caldas stand at either extremity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
of an extensive valley, opening to the west. In the centre
Obidos, with its ruined castle and splendid aqueduct, recalls
the days of Moorish glory. The village of Rolica stands on a
bold height, surrounded by vineyards and olive groves—and a
sandy plain extends in front, thickly studded with shrubs and
dwarf wood. The eminence on which the village is placed,
and where the French general formed his line of battle, had one
flank resting on a rugged height, and the other on a mountain
impassable to any but a goat-herd. Behind, lay a number of
passes through the ridges in his rear, affording Delaborde a
means of retreat; or, if he chose to contest them, a formidable
succession of mountain posts.</p>

<p>All the arrangements for attack having been completed on
the preceding evening, at dawn the British got under arms. A
sweeter morning never broke,—the mountain mists dispersed,
the sun shone gloriously out, a thousand birds were singing,
and myriads of wild flowers shed their fragrance around.
Nature seemed every where in quiet and repose—presenting a
strange contrast to the roar of battle which immediately succeeded,
and the booming of artillery, as, repeated by a thousand
echoes, it reverberated among the lately peaceful hills.</p>

<p>In three columns, the allied brigades left their bivouacs.
The right (Portuguese), consisting of twelve hundred infantry
and fifty dragoons, were directed to make a considerable detour,
turn the enemy’s left flank, and bear down upon his rear. The
left, two brigades of infantry, three companies of rifles, a
brigade of light artillery, and forty horse, were to ascend the
hills of Obidos, drive in Delaborde’s posts, and turn his right
at Rolica. Ferguson, who commanded, was also to watch lest
Loison should move from Rio Mayor, and, if he came up, engage
him, and prevent a junction with Delaborde. The centre,
composed of four brigades,—those of Hill, Crawford, Nightingale,
and Fane,—two brigades of guns, the remainder of the
cavalry, and four hundred caçadores,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> were directed to advance
up the heights and attack the enemy in front.</p>

<p>To traverse the distance between the British bivouac and
French outposts (three leagues), consumed a good portion of
the morning; and the march to the battle-ground, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
viewed with relevance to the beauty of its scenery, or the order
of its execution, was most imposing.</p>

<p>When sudden irregularities of the surface disturbed the order
of a column, it halted until the distances were corrected, and
then marched silently on with the coolness of a review. Presently
the light troops became engaged, the centre broke into
columns of regiments, while the left pressed forward rapidly,
and the rifles, on the right, bore down on the tirailleurs.
Delaborde’s position was now critical, for Ferguson, topping
the heights, threatened his rear. But the French general acted
promptly—he abandoned the plain, and falling back upon the
passes of the Sierra, took up a new position less assailable than
the former one; and, from the difficult nature of the mountain
surface, requiring, on Sir Arthur’s part, a new disposition of
attack.</p>

<p>Five separate columns were now formed, and to each a different
pass was allotted. The openings in the heights were so
narrow and difficult, that only a portion of the columns could
come into fire. The pass on the extreme right was attacked
by the Portuguese; the light troops of Hill’s brigade and the
5th regiment advanced against the second; the centre was to
be carried by the 9th and 29th, the fourth by the 45th, and
the fifth by the 82nd.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the front attack was made either too soon, or
difficulties had delayed the flanking corps—and, in consequence,
the passes were all stormed, before Delaborde had been even
aware that he was endangered on his flank and rear. Regardless
of the ground, than which nothing could be more formidable,
the assailants mounted the ravines. Serious obstacles met
them at every step—rocks and groves overhung the gorges in
the hills—and where the ground was tolerably open for a space
from rocks, it was covered thickly with brushwood and wild
myrtle. Thus the order of the column was deranged; while a
broken surface concealed the enemy, and suffered the French
to keep up a withering fusilade on troops who had not leisure
to return it.</p>

<p>The centre pass, on which the 29th and 9th were directed
to advance, was particularly difficult. The 29th led, and the
9th supported it. Entering the gorge undauntedly, the leading
companies were permitted to approach a ravine, with precipitous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
rocks on one side and a thick myrtle wood on the
other. From both a tremendous fire was unexpectedly opened.
In front and on the flanks, the men fell by dozens; and, as
the leading company was annihilated, the column, cumbered
by its own dead and wounded, was completely arrested in its
movement. But the check was only momentary. Colonel
Lake, who led the regiment on horseback, waved his hat and
called on the men to follow. A wild cheer was returned, and
a rush made up the pass. Notwithstanding the sustained
fusilade on every side, the forward movement was successful—and
after overcoming every attempt to repel their daring
charge, with diminished numbers the 29th crowned the
plateau.</p>

<p>But the enemy were not to be easily beaten. Before the
9th could clear the pass, or the 29th form their line, a French
battalion advanced and charged. They were most gallantly
received; a severe contest ensued; and, after a mutual
slaughter, the enemy were repulsed. With increased numbers,
again and again the charges were repeated and repelled.
At last the 9th got into action; and the head of the
5th regiment began to shew itself as it topped the summit of
the second pass. On every point the attacks had been successful—and
to save himself from being cut off, Delaborde
retired in perfect order; and from the difficulty of the ground
and his superiority in cavalry, although pressed by the light
troops, effected his retreat with little molestation.</p>

<p>This brilliant affair, from the strength of their position, and
the obstinacy with which the French contested every inch of
ground, cost the British a heavy loss. Even, when forced from
the heights, Delaborde attempted to take a new position, and
hold the village of Zambugeira. But he was driven back with
the loss of three guns—and retreating through the pass of Runa,
by a long night march, he gained Montecheque next day.</p>

<p>The French casualties in killed, wounded, and prisoners
amounted to a thousand men—and the British to about half
that number.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Delaborde was among the wounded—and
Colonel Lake in the return of the killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
As this promising officer was universally regretted, the following
anecdotes of one whom “the officers adored, the soldiers
revered, and there were few who would not have laid down
their lives for,” will not be uninteresting.</p>

<p>When immediately in the presence of the French 82nd, and
a combat seemed inevitable, Lake’s countenance appeared
glowing with delight. At this moment he turned round,
calling out, “Gentlemen, display the colours.” The colours
flew, the horse and he had another prance,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> when he turned
again, and addressed the line:—“Soldiers, I shall remain in
front of you, and remember that the bayonet is the only weapon
for a British soldier.” The French at this instant retired, and
the right of the 29th meeting the road, broke into sections and
followed through the village of Colombeira.</p>

<p>The following is a characteristic anecdote of this lamented
officer:</p>

<p>“The evening before the affair of Rolica, there was every
reason to believe the regiment would be among the first troops
engaged the next morning, and there were two bad subjects
under sentence of a court-martial for petty plundering. Colonel
Lake, when he formed his regiment in the evening for the
punishment of the two culprits, knew full well that every man
was satisfied they deserved it; but he did not say that. He
spoke to the hearts of his soldiers; he told them he flogged
those men not alone because they deserved it; but that he
might deprive them of the honour of going into action with
their comrades in the morning, and that he might not prevent
the guard who was stationed over them from participating in
it. The regiment was in much too high a state of discipline to
admit of a word being said, but they were repeated all the
evening from mouth to mouth; and the poor fellows who were
flogged declared to me that they would willingly on their
knees at his feet, if they dared, have begged, as the greatest
favour he could bestow, to be allowed to run the risk of being
shot first, with the certainty of being flogged afterwards if
they escaped.”</p>

<p>Mr. Guthrie thus describes his death:—“A narrow steep
ravine seemed the only accessible part—and up this Lake
without further hesitation, led his grenadiers on horseback.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
The whole regiment followed with unexampled devotion and
heroism, and gained the summit, but not without the loss of
three hundred men in the desperate conflict, which took place
almost hand to hand in the olive grove half way up the hill.
Broken and overpowered by numbers, Lake fell, and his soldiers
would have been driven down, if the 9th regiment had
not rushed up with equal ardour, led by a no less gallant
soldier, Colonel Stewart. The two regiments formed on the
crown of the hill, supported on their right by the 5th, which
had been less opposed, and the French retired, finding that
their right was by this time turned. Colonel Lake, on horseback
on the top of the hill, seemed to have a charmed life.
One French officer, of the name of Bellegarde, said afterwards
that he had fired seven shots at him. Once he seemed to
stagger as if he was hit, but it was only at the seventh shot
he fell. It is probable he was right, for he was wounded in
the back of the neck slightly; but the ball which killed him
passed quite through from side to side beneath the arms; I
think he must have fallen dead. The serjeant-major, Richards,
seeing his colonel fall, stood over him, like another Ajax,
until he himself fell wounded in thirteen places by shot and
bayonet. I gave him some water in his dying moments, and
his last words were, ‘I should have died happy if our gallant
colonel had been spared’—words that were reiterated by
almost every wounded man.”</p>

<p>Delaborde’s defeat having left the road to Torres Vedras
open, Sir Arthur pursued the French to Villa Verde, where
the British halted for the night—and cheered by his opening
success, the English leader seemed determined to improve it.
Orders were accordingly issued to prepare for a rapid march
next day, and “it seemed as if no check would be given to
the ardour of the troops till they should have won a second
victory.” But despatches were received that night, announcing
the arrival of General Anstruther with a reinforcement of
troops and stores. The fleet were reported to be at anchor off
Peniche; and, to cover the disembarkation, and unite himself
with the corps on board the transports, Sir Arthur’s
march was directed on Lourinho. There the British bivouacked
that night,—and on the next morning took a position
beside the village of Vimiero.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_8">VIMIERO.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Vimiero.—Interview between the British Generals ends unsatisfactorily.—Junot
unites his brigades, and advances.—Battle of Vimiero.—Burrard
refuses to advance.—Observations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vimiero stands at the bottom of a valley, and at the eastern
extremity of a ridge of hills extending westward towards the
sea. The river Maceira flows through it—and on the opposite
side, heights rise eastward, over which winds the mountain
road of Lourinho. In front of the village a plateau of some
extent is slightly elevated above the surrounding surface; but
it, in turn, is completely overlooked by the heights on either
side. The British, never anticipating an attack, had merely
taken up ground for the night, and with more attention to
convenience than security. Six brigades occupied the high
ground westward of Vimiero—one battalion, the 50th, with
some rifle companies, were bivouacked on the plateau, having
a half brigade of nines, and a half brigade of six pounders.
The eastern heights were occupied by pickets only, as water
could not be procured in the vicinity—and in the valley, the
cavalry and reserve artillery had taken their ground for the
night.</p>

<p>The communication immediately made by Sir Arthur Wellesley
to his senior officer, Sir Harry Burrard, both of the
past and the intended operations, had been unfavourably
received—and Sir Harry declined the daring but judicious step
of an immediate advance on Mafra, by which the position
taken by the French on the heights of Torres Vedras must
have been necessarily turned. In fact, to every suggestion of
Sir Arthur he raised continuous objections, and seemed totally
opposed to any forward movement. He pleaded, in apology
for inaction, that the cavalry was weak—the artillery badly
horsed; that a march, which should remove the British from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
their shipping, would interrupt their supplies and endanger
the army; and the best of the bad reasons which he gave, was
the expected arrival of Sir John Moore with a strong reinforcement.
It was useless in Sir Arthur Wellesley to point
out, as he did, the advantages of an advance, with an assurance,
which proved true, that if they did not, the French
would become assailants. Sir Harry appeared to have formed
a stubborn resolution of remaining quiet that no argument or
remonstrance could disturb—and Sir Arthur Wellesley
returned to his camp, convinced that the military incapacity of
his superior officer would, when it paralyzed early success as
it did that of Rolica, entail upon the expedition ulterior
disaster and disgrace. It was otherwise decreed—and the
decision of an enemy wreathed the laurel on Wellesley’s brow,
of which the timidity of a feeble-minded colleague would have
robbed him.</p>

<p>Delaborde had executed his orders to check the advance of
the British with a zeal and ability that added greatly to his
military reputation. Junot, in the interim, was actively
engaged in concentrating his brigades, and drawing every disposable
man from his garrisons, to enable him to bring a force
to bear against the British, that, from its superior formation,
must ensure success. His whole corps was formed into two
divisions; Delaborde commanding one, and Loison the other—while
the reserve, composed entirely of grenadiers, was
entrusted to Kellerman. All his dispositions having been
completed, the Duke of Abrantes advanced to Vimiero, where
he had ascertained that his enemy was halted.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur was awakened at midnight by a German officer
in charge of the outlying picket, with the intelligence of
Junot’s movements, and an assurance that an attack was certain,
as the French advance was not above a league distant.
Patrols were immediately sent out; and while every care was
taken against surprise, the line was not alarmed, nor the men
permitted to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Junot quitted his position on the evening of the 20th, and
marched all night by roads bad in themselves, and interrupted
by numerous defiles; consequently great delay occurred, and it
was seven o’clock next morning, when he arrived within four
miles of the British outposts. The formation of his columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
was effected unseen, as the broken ground behind which he
made his dispositions, entirely concealed his movements. The
first intimation of a serious attack was only given, when a
mass of Junot’s cavalry deployed in front of the picket that
was observing the Lourinho road. Perceiving instantly the
point on which the French were about to direct their column,
Sir Arthur crossed the ravine with the brigades of Ferguson,
Nightingale, Aucland, and Bowes, thus securing his weakest
point—the left—before Junot had made a demonstration
against it.</p>

<p>Presently the enemy’s columns came on; the right by the
Lourinho road, and left marching on the plateau, occupied by
the 50th and rifles. The onset of both divisions was made
with the usual impetuosity of Frenchmen, and in both the
British skirmishers were driven in.</p>

<p>The British right was furiously attacked. Unchecked by
the light troops covering the line, the French came boldly forward,
until it found itself directly in front of the 36th, 40th,
and 71st. It deployed instantly—and several volleys of
musketry were mutually returned, and at a distance so close
as to render the effect murderous. But the fusilade was ended
quickly; the 82nd and 29th pushed forward, and joined
their comrades when pressed by an enormous superiority.
“Charge!” was the order; and a cheer, “loud, regular, and
appalling,” announced that England was coming on.</p>

<p>The French stood manfully; but though they waited the
onset, they could not withstand it. They were driven from
the field—a vain attempt to rally, when the 71st and 82nd
had flung themselves on the ground to recover breath, failed—and
six guns were taken. The front rank of the French division
was literally annihilated—it lay as it had fallen—and
told with what determination it had stood, and the desperation
with which it had been assaulted.</p>

<p>On the left, the French column having pushed the rifles
before it, advanced upon the 50th formed in line. The regiment
was strong, numbering about nine hundred bayonets,
and supported by a half brigade of guns; and though the
French had seven pieces with their column, it suffered heavily
from the British canonnade. The enemy’s advance was made
in close order of half battalions. Sheltered from the fire of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the artillery, the French halted behind a broken hillock,
closed up their ranks, and advanced to the attack. The
50th remained until this moment with “ordered arms.”
With excellent judgment, the colonel, leaving the left wing of
his regiment in line, threw his right into echelons of companies,
and ordered it to form line upon the left. But there
was not time to complete the formation, as the enemy came
on, opening a hot but inefficient fire from its flanks. Part of
the right wing of the 50th bore directly on the angle of the
advancing column—and when within twenty paces, the order
was given to fire, and that to “charge!” succeeded. Broken
totally by the close discharge, the angle of the column forced
itself on the centre; all was instantly disorganized, and the
artillery cutting their traces, added to the confusion. The
British pressed on—the French got mobbed—and assisted by
part of the 20th light dragoons, a column five times numerically
superior, were for two miles fairly driven from their
ground by one regiment, until they were relieved by the
French cavalry reserve, which came up in a force not to be
resisted.</p>

<p>While these more important operations were repulsed, the
town of Vimiero was attacked by a lesser column (Kellerman’s
reserve), that had flanked the larger, and the 43rd regiment
was furiously assailed. One company occupied the
churchyard, another held some houses that covered the road
by which the French attack was made; and the fire of both
was so destructive, that the column was repelled with immense
slaughter. On the extreme left, the 97th and 52nd repulsed
Delaborde with considerable loss; on every point the attack
failed, and the field was won.</p>

<p>No troops fought better than the French—and no battle
could have been more determinately contested. The enemy’s
reserve “performed prodigies of valour, advancing under
cross fire of musketry and cannon, and never giving way until
the bayonets of the British troops drove them down the
descent.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> But they were routed on every side; and, with
relation to the numbers engaged, the slaughter was terrific.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Upwards of three thousand Frenchmen were killed and
wounded, and a number of prisoners made—while the British
loss was computed, in killed, wounded, and missing, at seven
hundred and eighty-three.</p>

<p>One casualty was sincerely deplored. In leading a squadron
of the 20th, Lieutenant-colonel Taylor was killed. He had
charged the broken infantry of Kellerman, and committed sad
havoc among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of the reserve—when, surrounded by a
whole brigade of French cavalry, he fell in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>, shot
through the heart.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Burrard landed after the battle commenced, but
very prudently left the termination of the contest in his hands
by whom the first dispositions had been made. Sir Harry
was not in time to assist in the victory—but he had ample
leisure to mar its results. Wellesley urged that this was the
moment to advance, push on to Torres Vedras, place Junot
between two fires, and oblige him to begin a retreat of immense
difficulty by Alenquer and Villa Franca. All was
admirably prepared for the movement. The supply of ammunition
was sufficient, provisions were abundant, and the
troops in high courage and superb discipline. The French, on
the contrary, were depressed by an unexpected defeat; and,
greatly disorganized and wearied by long marches, were
certain of being materially inconvenienced by an immediate
advance of the British.</p>

<p>But Sir Harry was immoveable. He had made his mind
up to await the arrival of Sir John Moore before he should
advance a step from Vimiero. A victory had been gained—a
complete and brilliant victory. But what was that to him?
“The cavalry,” he said, “were certainly not strengthened, nor
the artillery horses improved, by the exertions they had undergone.”
Stop he would—and Junot was permitted to return
without annoyance; and the British, who should have never
halted until they had reached Lisbon, rested on the ground
they won.</p>

<p>Is it not inconceivable, that Britain should have consigned
her armies to the leading of antiquated tacticians, bigoted in
old-world notions, and who would scarcely venture beyond a
second bridge, without spending half the day in reconnoitring?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
But such things were—and the energies of the first military
people in the world were paralyzed for half a century, by
commands being entrusted to men, who, in cases of ordinary
embarrassment, would have been found incompetent to extricate
a regiment from a difficulty. But such things were!</p>

<p>A period of inaction succeeded the victory at Vimiero. Burrard
was superseded in his command by Sir Hew Dalrymple—and
the convention of Cintra perfected, by which an army
was restored to France, that, had Sir Arthur Wellesley’s
advice been attended to, must have been eventually destroyed,
or driven into such extremity as should have produced an
unconditional surrender. Other articles in this disgraceful
treaty, recognised a full exercise of rights of conquest to the
French—secured to them the enormous plunder their rapacity
had accumulated—and granted an amnesty to every traitor
who had abandoned his country, and aided the invaders in
effecting its subjugation. No wonder that this precious convention
occasioned in England a universal feeling of disgust.
No wonder that blood spilled in vain, and treasure uselessly
wasted,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> roused popular indignation to a pitch of excitement
which no occurrence in modern history can parallel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
The particulars of the treaty of Cintra, immediately on
being known in England, occasioned the recall of Sir Hew
Dalrymple; while under the plea of ill health, his colleague,
Sir Harry Burrard, resigned and returned home. What a
different result the Portuguese campaign would have exhibited,
had these two old gentlemen been left in a district command,
and not been allowed to check a career of victory which
opened with such glorious promise!</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Wellesley had already returned to England,
and many officers of all ranks followed his example. The
command of the army devolved on Sir John Moore, a man
most deservedly respected by the country, and popular with
his soldiers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the general indication of national resistance to
French oppression on the part of the Spaniards, encouraged
hopes that if assisted by England, the independence of the
Peninsula might be restored. This was a consideration worthy
of a statesman’s serious regard in both France and Britain—for
the thraldom or independence of Spain was an object of
vital importance. As to what might be expected from the
Spaniards themselves in any attempt made for their own liberation,
their invaders and their allies seemed to have formed an
erroneous estimate—the English overrating the importance of
their exertions in the field, as much as the French undervalued
that patriotic impulse, which had wakened up the slumbering
spirit of the people. The British cabinet, however, determined
to foster this national feeling—and by munificent
supplies, and the presence of an English army, stimulate the
Spanish people to assert their lost liberty, and fling off a yoke
no longer tolerable. For this purpose, a force of twenty
thousand men was directed to be assembled at Valladolid—and
a reinforcement of thirteen thousand, under Sir David
Baird, was despatched from England to join them—the whole
were to be placed under the orders of Sir John Moore.</p>

<p>Although Sir David’s corps was landed by the middle of
October, the army of Lisbon was not in a condition to move
until the end of the month—and then, under a false belief
that the direct rout to Salamanca was impracticable for the passage
of artillery, the batteries and cavalry, with a protecting
brigade of three thousand infantry, were moved by Badajoz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
and the Escurial, entailing on them an additional march of
upwards of one hundred and fifty miles. Worse still, a delay
in commencing operations was unavoidable, and that was
attended with the worst results.</p>

<p>The whole of Sir John Hope’s corps having been at last
collected, and the cavalry assembled at Villa Vicosa, the order
to move forward was given. On the 5th of November, Sir
John Moore was at Atalia, on the 8th he reached Almeida,
and on the 11th his advanced guard crossed the rivulet that
divides Spain from Portugal, and entered Ciudad Rodrigo.
At San Martin he slept in the house of the curé—and occupied
the same bed that had the former year been assigned to
Junot and Loison on their respective marches—and on the
13th he entered Salamanca.</p>

<p>There, disastrous news awaited him—for one of his supporting
armies was already <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. Count Belvidere,
having made an absurd movement on Burgos, was attacked
by a superior force, and his raw levies completely routed;
while previously, Blake’s army had been utterly dispersed, and
the magazines at Reynosa taken. To add to this mass of
evil tidings, intelligence arrived that the fall of Madrid might
be confidently expected,—while, instead of his advance into
Spain being covered with an army of seventy thousand men,
Moore found himself in an open town without a gun, without
a Spanish picket, with only three infantry brigades, and the
French outposts but three marches distant.</p>

<p>Madrid fell—the news could not be credited—and it was
asserted that, though the Retiro was taken, the town held
obstinately out. The inaction of the British was generally
censured; the envoy had remonstrated on the subject; and
the army did not conceal their impatience. Influenced by
these considerations, Moore determined to make a diversion
on the capital, and attack Soult, who was at Saldanha, on the
Carion. A forward movement followed—Baird was directed
to march from Astorga, and Romana was informed of the
intended operation, and requested to assist.</p>

<p>This decision of attacking Soult was known to the army,
and gave general satisfaction.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> On the 16th, head-quarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
were at Toro—and passing Villapondo and Valderosa, on the
20th Sir John reached Majorga, and was joined by Baird’s
division, making an united force of twenty-three thousand five
hundred infantry, two thousand four hundred cavalry, and,
including a brigade of three-pounders—from its small calibre
perfectly useless,—an artillery of nearly fifty guns. Soult’s
corps amounted to sixteen thousand infantry and twelve
hundred dragoons. The great portion of the former were at
Saldanha—and Debelle’s cavalry at Sahagun.</p>

<p>While thus advancing, the brilliant affair between Lord
Paget and the French cavalry shed a passing glory on a series
of operations, whose results were generally so calamitous.
We shall give the affair in the words of the noble colonel of
the 10th Hussars, than whom, on that occasion, no one “by
daring deed” more effectually contributed to victory.</p>

<p>“The Monastero Melgar Abaxo is distant about three
leagues from Sahagun, in which place a corps of seven hundred
French cavalry were reported to be lodged. As they were at
some distance from the main body of the French army, it was
deemed practicable to cut them off, and Lord Paget determined,
at all events, to make the attempt. He accordingly
put himself at the head of the 10th and 15th Hussars, and in
the middle of a cold wintry night, when the direct rout to
Salamanca was impracticable, for the ground was covered with
snow, set off for that purpose.</p>

<p>“When they had ridden about two-thirds of the way, Lord
Paget divided his force, and desiring General Slade, with the
10th, to pursue the course of the Cea, and to enter the town
by that side, he himself, followed by the 15th, wheeled off to
approach it by a different route. It was not long before his
lordship’s party fell in with a picket of the enemy; and all,
except one man, were either cut down or made prisoners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
But the escape of one was as injurious, under existing circumstances,
as the escape of the whole; for the alarm was given,
and before the 15th could reach the place, the enemy were
ready to receive them. It was now broad daylight, and as
our troops drew near, the French were soon formed in what
appeared to be an open plain, at no great distance from the
town. The 15th were wheeled into line in a moment, and
as there was no time to be lost, they followed their leader at
a brisk trot, with the intention of charging; but when they
were yet fifty yards from the enemy, they found that a wide
ditch divided them, and that the French had availed themselves
of other inequalities in the ground, of which, when
some way off, they had not been aware. A pause was now
necessarily made, but one instant served to put the whole again
in motion. The regiment, wheeling to its left, soon found a
convenient place for crossing; and though the enemy manœuvred
actively to hinder the formation, they were again in
line, and advancing to the charge, within five minutes from
the commencement of the check. A few changes of ground
now took place, as each corps strove to gain the flank of the
other, but they were only a few. The British cavalry effected
its object—and then coming down at full speed upon their
opponents, who stood to receive the shock, they overthrew
them in an instant. Many were killed upon the spot, many
more unhorsed, and one hundred and fifty-seven were made
prisoners, including two lieutenant-colonels. On this occasion
the English cavalry amounted only to four hundred men,
whilst that of the French fell not short of seven hundred.”</p>

<p>The weather continued bad; the troops were a good deal
knocked up by forced marching, and Sir John halted on the
22nd and 23rd for supplies, intending by a night march to
reach the Carion, and attack Soult on the morrow. Every
account made the British numerically greater than the enemy—and
though the French had been reinforced, still
Moore’s army was stronger by fully five thousand men.</p>

<p>All dispositions were made for the intended attack. At
eight at night, the army were to move in two columns—and
the right, which was to force the bridge and penetrate to Saldanha,
was actually getting under arms, when couriers arrived
“loaded with heavy tidings.” The French were moving in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
directions to cut the English off;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> the corps which had been
marching south, was suddenly halted at Talavera; two strong
divisions were moving from Placentia; the Badajoz army was
in full march on Salamanca—and Napoleon himself in the
field, determined, as it was reported, to “sweep the British
before him to the ocean.”</p>

<p>This was, in truth, disastrous intelligence. The orders to
advance were countermanded instantly—the troops, who had
already been mustering, were retired to their quarters, and the
object of the expedition seemed virtually ended. The campaign
was indeed a tissue of mistakes—“operating with feeble
allies, acting on false information, advancing to-day, retiring
to-morrow, with every thing to harass and nothing to excite
the soldier, until at last, the ill-fated and ill-planned expedition
terminated in a ruinous retreat.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>In making preparations for a rapid march before an enemy,
that from report was overwhelming if not avoided, the 23rd
of December was consumed, and the general plan for regressive
operations was arranged by instantly retreating on Gallicia.</p>

<p>To pass the Esla, three routs were open,—one by the bridge
of Mansilla, a second by the ferry of Valencia, and a third by
the bridge of Castro Gonsalo, over which the great road to
Benevente leads. Mansilla was occupied and exhausted by
the Spanish army, and the roads of Valencia and Gonsalo
afforded the best retreat. A double means of retirement
would expedite the movements—and neither the magazines at
Lamora nor Benevente would be left to the French. Astorga
was named the point of union, as there, if pressed, battle
could be offered. Romana was requested to move upon Leon—after
holding, to the last extremity, the bridge of Mansilla.</p>

<p>All arrangements being completed, Moore commenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
retreating on the 24th. Hope’s division fell back on Castro
Gonzalo, and Baird’s on Valencia; while cavalry patrols were
pushed forward on the Carion, with orders to retire at nightfall
of the 25th, giving the reserve and light infantry, which
formed the rear-guard, a start of some three or four hours in
advance. All was admirably executed—and the columns,
unmolested, reached their respective destinations.</p>

<p>The retreat continued, marked by some occasional affairs
between the cavalry of the advanced and rear-guard, which
terminated invariably in favour of the latter. The hussar
regiments behaved most nobly—and on every occasion, regardless
of numbers, or the more discouraging movements of a
retreat, they sought the combat, and always came off the conquerors.</p>

<p>The infantry already began to experience the annoyance of
long marches, severe weather, and a very indifferent commissariate.
To march over cut-up roads, and through an
exhausted country, where no friendly place of strength protects,
no well-supplied magazine refreshes, soon harasses the
over-loaded soldier. But that, when accomplished in the
dead of winter,—in cold and darkness, sleet and rain,—was
enough to have subdued the spirit of any army but a British
one, retiring under every privation, and with seventy thousand
veteran troops marching on their flanks and rear.</p>

<p>The army reached Benevente on the 27th—and the crossing
of the Esla,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> though exceedingly troublesome, was effected
with inconsiderable loss. The roads were wretched, the weather
bad, and the French pursuit marked by the fiery character
of their emperor. He crossed<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> the Carpenteras, regardless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
of obstacles that would have discouraged the boldest—and, in
a hurricane of sleet and hail, passed his army over the Guadarama,
by a rout declared impracticable even to a mountain
peasant.</p>

<p>This bold operation, worthy of the conqueror of Italy, was
followed up by an immediate advance. On the 26th the
main body of the British continued retreating on Astorga,—the
bridge across the Esla was destroyed—and the night of
the 27th passed over in tolerable quiet. In the morning,
however, the French were seen actively employed. Five
hundred cavalry of the guard tried for the ford above the
ruined bridge, found it, and passed over. The pickets forming
the rear-guard at once confronted them,—and, led on by
Colonel Otway, charged repeatedly, and checked the leading
squadron. General Stuart put himself at the head of the
pickets, while Lord Anglesea rode back to bring up the 10th.
Charges were made on both sides; the pickets gave ground—the
French advanced, but the 10th were speedily at hand,
and came forward. The pickets rallied,—they cheered and
cut boldly in at speed—the French were overthrown and
driven across the river, with the loss of their Colonel (Le
Fevre), and seventy officers and men.</p>

<p>This brilliant encounter had the results that boldness wins.
The French kept a respectful distance, and thus, the column
was enabled to gain Astorga without further molestation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
But the danger was momently increasing. From prisoners
taken in the cavalry affair on the Esla, it was ascertained
that, on the preceding evening, the head-quarters of Napoleon’s
own corps were but sixteen miles from the bivouacs of
the British—and to reach Villa Franca before the French was
imperatively necessary. On that event how much depended,—for
on the possession of that road, in a great degree, would
rest the safety or destruction of the British, as it opens
through a defile into a country that for miles renders cavalry
movements impracticable, and entirely protects the flanks of a
retiring army.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how quickly a retreat in bad weather
destroys the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i> of the best army. The British divisions
had marched from Sabugal on the 24th in the highest order;
on the 30th, on reaching Astorga, their disorganization had
commenced—they seemed a mob flying from a victorious
enemy, and General Moore himself exhibited a despondency
that was apparent to all around him. “That he was an
officer of great distinction every one acknowledged during
his life, and posterity will never deny it; but it was too
manifest that a fear of responsibility, a dread of doing that
which was wrong, of running himself and his troops into
difficulties from which they might not be able to extricate
themselves, were a great deal too active to permit either his
talents or his judgment properly to exert their influence.
Sir John Moore had earned the highest reputation as a general
of division; he was aware of this, and perhaps felt no inclination
to risk it; at all events he was clearly incapable of
despising partial obstacles in the pursuit of some great
ultimate advantage;—in one word, he was not a Wellington.
Of this no more convincing proof need be given than the fact
that, even at the moment when the preparations for the brief
advance were going on, his whole heart and soul seemed
turned towards the Portuguese frontier.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Romana had unfortunately given up the Leon rout, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
marching on Astorga, encumbering the roads with the ruins
of his baggage, and worse still, filling the villages he passed
through with crowds of ragged followers unable to get on—some
from absolute decrepitude and want, and more from
being attacked by fever of the worst type.</p>

<p>The retreat was renewed next morning—and the marching
continued with such constancy that, by abandoning the sick
and wounded, wasting the ammunition, and destroying the
stores, the British outstripped pursuit, and on the 3rd of
January found themselves in comparative safety. The cavalry,
as usual, distinguished themselves; and at Cacabelos, where
the rear-guard was overtaken, behaving with their customary
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i>, they repelled the advance of the French hussars, and
prevented the light troops from being surrounded and cut off.
Indeed the escape of the rifles was wonderful. They were
retreating through the town, and part of the rear-guard had
already crossed the bridge, when the French cavalry came suddenly
on in overwhelming force, and galloping into the rear
companies of the 95th, succeeded in making some prisoners.
The rifles instantly broke into skirmishing order, and commenced
retiring up the hill, when a body of voltigeurs rushed
to the support of the cavalry, and the affair became serious.
The 95th, however, had now thrown themselves into the
vineyards behind the town, and kept up a rapid and well-directed
fire. The French attempted to get in their rear, and
charged boldly up the road, led on by General Colbert. But
the fusilade from the vineyard, was maintained with such
precision that the French were driven back, leaving a number
of dead on the field, among whom their brave and daring
leader was included.</p>

<p>Sir John was also threatened with attack at Villa Franca.
A strong column of infantry appeared on the heights, in full
march on that division which was in position on the opposite
hill. The artillery opened, and an engagement appeared
inevitable. But checked by the cannonade, the forward
movement of the French was arrested; and Sir John, anxious
to reach the better position of Lugo, continued his retreat,
and prudently avoided coming to a general action, where the
ground had no military advantage to induce him to risk a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
combat. The main body marched to Herrieras, the reserve to
Villa Franca, and the rear-guard moved at ten o’clock, and
reached its bivouac at midnight.</p>

<p>The cavalry, no longer serviceable in a country rough,
hilly, and wooded, with numerous enclosures around vineyards
and plantations of mulberry trees, were sent on to Lugo;
the infantry and artillery marching for the same place.
During the whole day and night that distressing movement
was executed—and forty miles were passed over roads on
every side broken up, and in places, knee-deep. Never will
that dreadful march be forgotten by those who witnessed it.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
The men dropped down by whole sections on the wayside
and died—some with curses, some with the voice of prayer
in their mouths—while women and children—of whom an
immense number had injudiciously been allowed to accompany
the army—shared a similar fate. Horrible scenes momentarily
occurred,—children frozen in their mothers’ arms, women
taken in labour, and, of course, perishing with their ill-fated
progeny. Some were trying by the madness of intoxication
to stimulate their worn-out frames to fresh exertion—or, when
totally exhausted, to stupify the agonies of the slow but
certain death that cold and hunger must inevitably produce
before another sun dawned. It was awful to observe the
different modes, when abandoned to die, in which the miserable
wretches met their fate. Some lay down in sullen composure—others
vented their despair in oaths, and groans, and
curses—and not a few in heart-rending prayers to heaven
that the duration of their sufferings might be abridged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
From an early period of the retreat, the discipline of the
troops was shaken by rapid movements and an absence of
regular supplies. Hence, the men were obliged to shift as
they best could,—and this laxity in discipline gradually
increasing, ended in frequent scenes of drunkenness, rioting,
and robbery. Every town and village was sacked in search
of food, the wine stores plundered, and the casks, in mere
wantonness, broken and spilled. Nothing could check the
licentious spirit of the troops; and when a man was hanged
at Benivedre, even that sad example had not the least effect,
for many of the marauders were detected in the act of plundering
within sight of the fatal tree.</p>

<p>During this distressing movement, the French had pressed
the British rear-guard closely, and a constant scene of skirmishing
ensued. Though invariably checked by the light
troops, still the army was hourly becoming less effective—every
league reducing it both in numbers and resources.
Quantities of arms and necessaries were abandoned or destroyed;
and two bullock carts loaded with dollars were thrown
over a precipice into the bed of a mountain torrent.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> All
these things proved how desperately reduced that once fine
and well-appointed army had become. Indeed its appearance
was rather that of a procession of maimed invalids with a
caravan of sick soldiers, than an army operating in front of
a determined enemy, and expecting momently to come to
action.</p>

<p>It was a matter of surprise to all, that the French leader
did not force on an engagement; but, on the contrary, Soult
followed this half-ruined army with a caution that appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
unaccountable and unnecessary. Still the moment of attack
could not be distant; and it was certain that the Marshal
only waited for some embarrassment in the march, to throw
his leading divisions on the retreating brigades of England,
and force on a decisive battle.</p>

<p>This event was particularly to be dreaded while passing
the bridge and village of Constantino. A long and difficult
mountain road leads to the summit of a bold height, down
which it winds again by a gradual descent till it meets the
bridge. The occupation of this height, before the columns
had passed the river, would expose them to a heavy fire; and
Sir John Moore determined to check the French pursuit, and
hold the hill, until the rear of the main division had cleared
the bridge and village. His dispositions were quickly made,—the
28th regiment with the rifle corps were drawn up beside
the river—and the 20th, 52nd, and 91st on a hill immediately
in their rear, flanked by the horse artillery.</p>

<p>The French attacked with their usual spirit. The cavalry
and tirailleurs advanced against the bridge; but the fire from
the British riflemen, assisted by the guns on the height, drove
them back with loss. A second and a third attack, made
with equal boldness, ended in a similar result—and darkness
put a stop to the fighting. The French withdrew their light
troops, the British continued their retreat, and before morning
broke the rear-guard joined the army, now bivouacked in
position, or cantoned in and around the town of Lugo.</p>

<p>“The concentration of so many troops at this wretched
place produced a scene of hurry and confusion with which the
distant cannonade at the bridge of Constantino seemed in perfect
keeping.</p>

<p>“On one side was to be seen the soldier of every rank who
had secured a habitation to shelter him, but whom duty or
inclination occasioned to wander through the crowds of people,
and deeply mudded streets of the town; on the other, the disconsolate
person that made his appearance after the Alcalde’s
ingenuity had been stretched to the uttermost in procuring
quarters for the troops already arrived, and whose <em>personal
friends</em> had been subjected to the unusual order for admitting
strangers. The pitiableness of his case was either to be discovered
by a resigned and woeful visage, or by certain ebullitions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
of temper, destined to waste themselves in the desert
air. Next were to be seen the conductors of baggage, toiling
through the streets, their laden mules almost sinking under the
weight of ill-arranged burdens swinging from side to side,
while the persons in whose charge they had followed the divisions
appeared undecided which to execrate most, the roads,
the mules, the Spaniards, or the weather. These were succeeded
by the dull, heavy sound of the passing artillery; then
came the Spanish fugitives from the desolating line of the
armies. Detachments with sick or lamed horses scrambled
through the mud, while, at intervals, the report of a horse-pistol
knelled the termination to the sufferings of an animal
that a few days previously, full of life and high in blood, had
borne its rider not against, but over, the ranks of Gallic
chivalry. The effect of this scene was rendered more striking
by the distant report of cannon and musketry, and more
gloomy by torrents of rain, and a degree of cold worthy of a
Polish winter.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Preparations were made for a battle, and Sir John Moore
seemed determined to retreat no further. Notwithstanding
the British were suffering from cold, and wet, and hunger,
they fell into their position with alacrity. The Minho protected
their right, and a ravine separated them from the
French, who, already in force, occupied the heights, and were
evidently preparing for an immediate effort.</p>

<p>On the 6th the French deployed upon the heights, and the
British stood to their arms. Some hours passed; each line
looked at the other, as if waiting for its opening movement.
The day passed,—and at night the hostile armies occupied the
same bivouacs, on which their brigades had rested the preceding
evening.</p>

<p>The 7th came: with the first dawn, as if to make up for
its previous inactivity, the French guns opened. Their battery
was but weak, and the fire of the British artillery silenced it.
A pause ensued,—the day wore on—the evening was closing,—when
a column of considerable strength, covered by a cloud
of tirailleurs, steadily mounted the hill, driving in the pickets
and a wing of the 76th. The 51st was instantly moved to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
assistance, musketry was interchanged, a bayonet rush succeeded,
the French were driven down the hill, and operations
terminated.</p>

<p>“Darkness came on,—a wild and stormy night,—a lonely
hill,—no fire, no food,—such was the bivouac of Lugo;—such
the wretched and cheerless situation of the harassed but unconquerable
islanders.</p>

<p>“As the morning of the 8th dawned, the British formed
line, and prepared coolly for the expected encounter; but it
passed over, and the enemy made no hostile movement. The
troops had been ordered to bivouac as they best could—and in
a short time a number of rude huts were erected to defend
them from the inclemency of the coming night. But it was
not intended to remain longer before Lugo. When darkness
hid their retreat, the British filed off silently by the rear.
Through a frightful storm of hail and wind, their march was
bravely executed; and leaving Lugo and Valmela behind
them, they halted at Betanzos on the 10th.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Here the exhausted soldiery were halted from sheer necessity.
They were literally marched to a stand-still,—and,
although the rain fell in torrents, they lay down upon the
soaked earth, and in that comfortless situation remained until
at evening the ranks were again formed, and the retreat continued
on Corunna, where Sir John had now decided on embarking
the ruins of his army.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the wearied troops, the French, deceived by
the fires left burning when the British commenced their night
march from Lugo, did not discover the movement until daylight,
and thus twelve hours were gained on the pursuers.
This lost time could not be recovered; and although the whole
of the 10th was passed in Betanzos,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> to allow stragglers to
rejoin their regiments, no serious attempt was made to embarrass
the remainder of the march, and the leading division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
reached Corunna at noon of the 11th, while the reserve occupied
the adjoining villages, and the remaining brigades took
up their quarters in the suburbs.</p>

<p>Corunna afforded a very indifferent position to offer battle
on. There was one, but its extent made it untenable by an
army so weak in number as the British. After a close examination,
the rising ground above the village of Elvina, a mile
in front of the town, was the place selected by the general;
the position was accordingly marked out, and the brigades
moved to their allotted posts.</p>

<p>A ridge commanded the Betanzos road and formed the left
of the line, and on this General Hope’s division was placed.
Sir David Baird’s was next in station, and occupied a succession
of knolls that swept inwards, and inclined to a valley
beyond the Vigo road. Over the low grounds the rifle corps
were extended, appuied upon Frazer’s division, which, placed
in echellon, covered the principal approach to Corunna.
Paget’s division was in reserve behind Hope’s, and occupied a
village half a mile in the rear.</p>

<p>The enemy appeared beyond the Mero while these dispositions
were being made; but, with the exception of a partial
cannonade, no hostile demonstration occurred. On the 14th,
the artillery had ceased on both sides—an unusual quiet
ensued,—and nothing seemed likely to produce any immediate
excitement, when the explosion of four thousand barrels of
gunpowder burst upon the astonished ear. It is impossible to
describe the effect.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> The unexpected and tremendous crash
seemed for the moment to have deprived every person of reason
and recollection; “the soldiers flew to their arms, nor was
it until a tremendous column of smoke, ascending from the
heights in front, marked from whence the astounding shock
proceeded, that reason resumed its sway. It is impossible
ever to forget the sublime appearance of the dark dense cloud
of smoke that ascended, shooting up gradually like a gigantic
tower into the clear blue sky. It appeared fettered in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
enormous mass; nor did a particle of dust or vapour, obscuring
its form, seem to escape as it rolled upwards in majestic
circles.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>On the 15th the fleet hove in sight, and immediate preparations
were made to effect an embarkation of the army. The
women and children, with the sick and wounded, were directly
carried on board; a large portion of the artillery and stores
was sent afterwards; and the cavalry, after destroying the
few horses that still remained, were embarked. None but the
infantry, and of these such only as were effective, were now
left; and the belief was general, that they too, would be permitted
to retire from their position unmolested.</p>

<p>Every thing on the 16th continued quiet. The boats pulled
from the shipping to the beach, and orders were issued for the
divisions to move down, and prepare for immediate embarkation;
Sir John Moore was on horseback to visit the outposts,
for the last time, before they should be withdrawn, when an
officer came up hastily, and announced that the French were
under arms. The intelligence was correct; for an instant
fusilade commenced between their tirailleurs and the English
pickets, as their light troops pushed forward, covering the
advance of four compact columns. Two directed their march
upon the right, one moved upon the centre, while the fourth
threatened the left of the English line.</p>

<p>The right, consisting of the 4th, 42nd, and 50th, supported
by the guards, were fiercely attacked, and the reserve ordered
to sustain it. The French threw out a cloud of skirmishers,
supported by the fire of eleven pieces of artillery,—and driving
the advanced posts before them, came forward with their
customary boldness. On deploying partially, their line extended
considerably beyond the extreme right of the British,
but this was disregarded, and instead of waiting the attack,
the regiments gallantly advanced to meet it. The 4th suddenly
refusing its right wing, shewed a double front,—and
unawed by a superior enemy, undaunted by a heavy and well-directed
cannonade, the manœuvre of this splendid regiment
was executed with all the coolness and precision of a parade.</p>

<p>For a time the irregularity of ground intersected by numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
enclosures, kept the combatants apart; but these were
speedily surmounted, and the French assault was made and
repelled—and the village of Elvina, which had for a few
minutes been in possession of the enemy, was recovered by the
50th with the bayonet.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>The action was now general along the line. The 42nd, and
a battalion of the Guards, by a brilliant charge drove back the
French; and, failing to force, Soult endeavoured to turn the
British right, and accordingly marched a column in its rear.
That, the reserve attacked, and repulsed it with heavy loss.
In every point Soult’s attacks failed—and, altering his dispositions,
he took ground considerably to the right.</p>

<p>While the 42nd were lowering their bayonets, and Sir John
Moore was encouraging the charge, a round shot knocked him
from his horse, shattering his left arm at the shoulder—while
immediately before, Sir David Baird had been wounded and
removed. But the fall of their generals produced no serious
results. Corunna was not a battle of manœuvre, but a field
of determined resistance. The officers commanding the different
battalions fought their regiments gallantly; the dispositions
for the engagement were simple and understood; the
attempts upon the left and centre were repulsed; and the
French, beaten on every point, fell back as night came on.</p>

<p>Thus ended the conflict of Corunna;—and when every disadvantage
is taken into consideration under which the British
fought, its results were glorious, and the courage and coolness
displayed throughout most honourable to the troops employed.
The numbers engaged were certainly in favour of the French.
Without its light brigade, which had retreated and embarked
at Vigo, the British divisions scarcely reached to fifteen thousand;
while Soult was reinforced in the morning, and mustered
from eighteen to twenty thousand men. The loss on both
sides was severe; that of the British amounting to eight hundred
killed and wounded, while the French admitted theirs to
be at least double that number.</p>

<p>Yet it was but a melancholy triumph. The sad reverses of
the retreat, the abandonment of the country, and the death of
a brave and beloved commander, clouded the hour of conquest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
and threw a depressing gloom around, that seemed fitter to mark
a defeat than attend a well-won victory. No further attempt
was made by the enemy—the brigades were removed after
dark,—the embarkation continued<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>—and on the afternoon of
the 17th, the whole fleet was under weigh, steering for England
with a leading wind.</p>

<p>The severity of a wound like Sir John Moore’s, precluded,
from the first moment it was received, all hope of his surviving
beyond an hour or two. The arm was torn nearly from the
shoulder, and the collar-bone partially carried away; but, notwithstanding
the desperate hemorrhage that ensued, the sufferer
preserved his recollection, and remained in mental possession
to the last.</p>

<p>He was carried from the field in a blanket by six soldiers,
who evinced their sympathy by tears; and when a spring
waggon came up, and it was proposed that Sir John should be
transferred to it, the poor fellows respectfully objected, “as
they would keep step, and carry him more easily.” Their
wishes were attended to—and the dying general was conveyed
slowly to his quarters in the town, occasionally stopping
the bearers to look back upon the field, whenever an increasing
fire arrested his attention. All hope was over—he lingered
for a little, talking feebly, but collectedly, to those
around, and dividing his last thoughts apparently, between his
country and his kindred. The kindliness of his disposition
was in death remarkable. Turning to an aid-de-camp, he
desired to be remembered to his sister—and feebly pressing
Colonel Anderson’s hand, his head dropped back, and he died
without a struggle.</p>

<p>As a wish had been expressed by the departed, that he
should be laid in the field on which he fell, the rampart of the
citadel was happily chosen for his “resting place.” A working
party of the 9th turned up the earth—and at midnight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
wrapped in a cloak and blanket, his uncoffined remains were
interred by the officers of his staff—the burial-service was
read by torch-light,—earth fell on kindred clay,—the grave
was filled,—and, in the poet’s words, “They left him alone
with his glory.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>The benefits derived to an army from the example of a
distinguished commander, do not terminate at his death; his
virtues live in the recollections of his associates, and his fame
remains the strongest incentive to great and glorious actions.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
In Sir John Moore this was pointedly true; for in public and
private life none was more amiable—none, certainly, more
exemplary. But, speaking professionally, one is at this day,
astonished at the different estimates then formed of his qualifications
as a general. Nearly forty years have elapsed, and
time best determines the abilities of men—popular clamour,
whether favourable or unfriendly, loses its temporary influence—and
the merits or defects of departed greatness can, at an
after period, be dispassionately examined and adjudged.</p>

<p>In every private relation, Sir John Moore’s character was
perfect—and his professional career had always been distinguished.
Of no man had higher hopes been formed—and
hence, probably, more was expected by his country, than either
his means or his talents could effect. By one party he was
unjustly censured—by another injudiciously praised; and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
this ferment of opinion, it is difficult to say whether his military
reputation was most endangered by the obloquy of his
enemies or the over-praise of his friends.</p>

<p>Sir John Moore was a brave, high-minded, and accomplished
soldier; understood the details of his profession, and
laboured assiduously<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> to carry them into operation. He was
an excellent commander <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en second</i>,—but he never could
handle masses of men, like Napoleon or Wellington—grapple
with difficulties when they unexpectedly occurred—and, when
apparently on the verge of defeat, change, by his own resources,
the fortunes of a field, and turn an unpromising morning into
an evening of victory. For this he was constitutionally
unfitted. He laboured under an excessive sensibility that
embarrassed his decisions. A fever of the mind, which robs
the judgment of its energy, was frequently apparent; and
sentiments and language will be found in every portion of his
correspondence,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> which, while they indicate an amiable disposition,
are sadly out of keeping with that stern sufficiency of
thought, that should mark the unhesitating character of a
commander. Moore wanted confidence in himself; he was
afraid of responsibility; he underrated the qualities of his own
troops, and greatly overrated those of his adversary. Yet, let
justice be done. He acted under circumstances at once difficult
and trying; and he was harassed in being made, in some
degree, dependent upon the opinions of others. Lord Londonderry,
who does ample justice to the memory of Moore, says,
“The British army has produced some abler men; and many,
in point of military talent, were and are quite his equals; but
it cannot, and perhaps never could, boast of one more beloved,
not by his personal friends alone, but by every individual
that served under him.”</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Consequences of the embarkation.—Wretched position of Spanish affairs.—State
of Portugal.—Memoir of the Guerillas.</p></blockquote>

<p>The immediate consequence of the embarkation, was the
surrender of Corunna on the second day from that on which
the once proud army of England quitted the coast of Spain.
Ferrol soon followed the example—and in both these places,
an immense supply of stores and ammunition was obtained.
All effective resistance was apparently at an end—and French
dominion seemed established in Gallicia more strongly than it
had ever been before.</p>

<p>In every part of Spain, the cause of freedom appeared
hopeless. One campaign was closed, and never did one end
more hopelessly;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>—an unvarying scene of misfortune from
the commencement, it seemed to have withered every national
feeling that might have existed in Spanish breasts. Fortresses
that should have held out, provisioned, garrisoned, and open
to receive supplies from England, surrendered to a weak
army, who could not command “a battering gun or siege store<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
within four hundred miles.” In fact, Spanish resistance
seemed a mockery. Their military force was now the ruins
of Romana’s army, and some half-starved fugitives who
occasionally appeared in Estremadura and La Mancha,—while
the French had nearly two hundred thousand veteran troops
covering the whole country,—and these too in masses, that
set any hostile demonstration at defiance.</p>

<p>Portugal, in its military footing, was nearly on a par with
Spain. A British corps, under Sir John Craddock, garrisoned
Lisbon—and, that place excepted, there were no troops in the
kingdom on which the slightest dependence could be placed.
The appointment of Marshal Beresford to a chief command,
produced in time a wonderful reformation. The English system
of drill was successfully introduced,—and, before the war
ended, the Portuguese, when brigaded with the British, were
always respectable in the field, and sometimes absolutely brilliant.
At this period, there was but one national force in the
least degree formidable to the invaders—and that was the
Spanish Guerillas.</p>

<p>The Spanish armies in the course of the Peninsular campaign
had met so many and discouraging defeats, that their military
reputation sunk below the standard of mediocrity. They
were despised by their enemies, and distrusted by their allies,
and whether from the imbecility of the government, the
ignorance of their leaders, or some national peculiarity, their
inefficiency became so notorious, that no important operation
could be entrusted to them with any certainty of its being
successful. As an organized force, the Spanish army was
contemptible; while, in desultory warfare, the peasantry were
invaluable. With few exceptions, the history of Spanish
service would be a mere detail of presumption and defeat;
while their neighbours, the Portuguese, merited the perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
approbation of their officers, and proved worthy of standing
in the battle-field by the side of British soldiers.</p>

<p>The irregular bands, termed Partidas and Quadrillas, partly
formed from peasant volunteers and smugglers, and enlisted
and paid by government, were embodied originally by order
of the Central Junta. At first their numbers were few, and
their efficiency as military partisans not very remarkable—but
as the Spanish armies declined in strength and reputation,
the guerillas proportionately increased. The most determined
spirits would naturally select a life of wild and desperate
adventure<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>—and a love of country and religion, an unextinguishable
hatred of oppression, inflamed the passions of a
people proverbial for the intensity of feeling with which they
regarded even an imaginary insult. They had now deep
and heart-burning injuries to stimulate them to hatred and
revenge,—and the ferocity with which they retaliated for past
and present wrong, gained for these formidable partisans a
name that made the boldest of their oppressors tremble.</p>

<p>A brief sketch of this wild and devoted confederacy, so
connected with the Peninsular operations during that arduous
struggle, will not be irrelevant.</p>

<p>“There was in the whole system of guerilla warfare a wild
and romantic character, which, could its cruelty have been
overlooked, would have rendered it both chivalrous and
exciting—and men, totally unfitted by previous habits and
education suddenly appeared upon the stage, and developed
talent and determination, that made them the scourge and
terror of the invaders.</p>

<p>“But theirs was a combat of extermination,—none of those
courtesies, which render modern warfare endurable, were
granted to their opponents,—the deadliest hostility was
unmitigated by success,—and, when vanquished, expecting
no quarter from the French, they never thought of extending
it to those who unfortunately became their prisoners. A sanguinary
struggle was waging, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">væ victis</i> seemed, with
‘war to the knife,’ to be the only mottos of the guerilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
“The strange exploits of many of these daring partisans,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
though true to the letter, are perfectly romantic; and their
patient endurance, and the deep artifice with which their
objects were affected, appear to be almost incredible. Persons,
whose ages and professions were best calculated to evade
suspicion, were invariably their chosen agents. The village
priest was commonly a confederate of the neighbouring
guerilla,—the postmaster betrayed the intelligence that reached
him in his office,—the fairest peasant of Estremadura would
tempt the thoughtless soldier with her beauty, and decoy him
within range of the bullet; even childhood was frequently and
successfully employed in leading the unsuspecting victim into
some pass or ambuscade, where the knife or musket closed
his earthly career.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>In every community, however fierce and lawless, different
gradations of good and evil will be discovered, and nothing
could be more opposite than the feelings and actions of some
of the guerillas and their leaders.</p>

<p>Many of these desperate bands were actuated in every
enterprise by a love of bloodshed and spoliation, and their
own countrymen suffered as heavily from their rapacity, as
their enemies from their swords. Others took the field from
nobler motives; an enthusiastic attachment to their country
and religion roused them to vengeance against a tyranny
which had now become insufferable,—every feeling but ardent
patriotism was forgotten—private and dearer ties were snapped
asunder,—homes, and wives, and children, were abandoned,—privations,
that appear almost incredible, were patiently
endured, until treachery delivered them to the executioner,
or in some wild attempt they were overpowered by numbers,
and died resisting to the last.</p>

<p>Dreadful as the retaliation was which French cruelty and
oppression had provoked, the guerilla vengeance against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
domestic treachery was neither less certain nor less severe.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
To collect money or supplies for the invaders, convey any
information, conceal their motions, and not betray them when
opportunity occurred, was certain death to the offender.
Sometimes the delinquent was brought, with considerable
difficulty and risk, before a neighbouring tribunal, and executed
with all the formalities of justice; but, generally, a more
summary vengeance was exacted, and the traitor executed
upon the spot. In these cases, neither calling nor age were
respected—and, if found false to his country, the sanctity of
his order was no protection to the priest.</p>

<p>The daughter of the collector of Almagro, for professing
attachment to the usurper, was stabbed by Urena to the heart,—and
a secret correspondence between the wife of the Alcalde
of Birhueda and the French general in the next command,
having been detected by an intercepted despatch, the wretched
woman, by order of Juan Martin Diez, “the Empecinado,”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
was dragged by a guerilla party from her house, her hair
shaven, her denuded person tarred and feathered, and disgracefully
exhibited in the public market-place,—and she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
then put to death amid the execrations of her tormentors.
Nor was there any security for a traitor, even were his residence
in the capital, or almost within the camp of the enemy.
One of the favourites of Joseph Buonaparte, Don Jose Riego,
was torn from his home in the suburbs of Madrid, while celebrating
his wedding, by the Empecinado, and hanged in the
square of Cadiz. The usurper himself, on two occasions, narrowly
escaped from this desperate partisan. Dining at Almeida,
some two leagues distance from the capital, with one of the
generals of division, their hilarity was suddenly interrupted
by the unwelcome intelligence that the Empecinado was at
hand, and nothing but a hasty retreat preserved the pseudo-king
from capture. On another occasion, he was surprised
upon the Guadalaxara-road, and so rapid was the guerilla
movement, so determined the pursuit, that before the French
could be succoured by the garrison of Madrid, forty of the
royal escort were sabred between Torrejon and El Molar.</p>

<p>A war of extermination raged, and on both sides blood
flowed in torrents. One act of cruelty was as promptly
answered by another; and a French decree, ordering that
every Spaniard taken in arms should be executed, appeared to
be a signal to the guerillas to exclude from mercy every enemy
who fell into their hands. The French had shown the example;
the Junta were denounced, their houses burned, and their
wives and children driven to the woods. If prisoners received
quarter in the field,—if they fell lame upon the march, or the
remotest chance of a rescue appeared, they were shot like dogs.
Others were butchered in the towns, their bodies left rotting
on the highways, and their heads exhibited on poles. That
respect, which even the most depraved of men usually pay to
female honour, was shamefully disregarded,—and more than
one Spaniard, like the postmaster of Medina, was driven to
the most desperate courses, by the violation of a wife and the
murder of a child.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>It would be sickening to describe the horrid scenes which
mutual retaliation produced. Several of the Empecinado’s
followers, who were surprised in the mountains of Guadarama,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
were nailed to the trees, and left there to expire slowly by
hunger and thirst. To the same trees, before a week elapsed,
a similar number of French soldiers were affixed by the
guerillas. Two of the inhabitants of Madrid, who were suspected
of communicating with the brigands, as the French
termed the armed Spaniards, were tried by court-martial, and
executed at their own door. The next morning, six of the
garrison were seen hanging from walls besides the high road.
Some females related to Palarea, surnamed the Medico, had
been abused most scandalously by the escort of a convoy, who
had seized them in a wood; and in return the guerilla general
drove into an Ermida eighty Frenchmen and their officers, set
fire to the thatch, and burned them to death, or shot them
in their endeavours to leave the blazing chapel. Such were
the dreadful enormities a system of retaliation caused.</p>

<p>These desperate adventurers were commanded by men of
the most dissimilar professions. All were distinguished by
some <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sobriquet</i>, and these were of the most opposite descriptions.
Among the leaders were friars and physicians, cooks
and artisans; while some were characterized by a deformity,
and others named after the form of their waistcoat or hat.
Worse epithets described many of the minor chiefs,—truculence
and spoliation obtained them titles; and, strange as it
may appear, the most ferocious band that infested Biscay was
commanded by a woman named Martina. So indiscriminating
and unrelenting was this female monster in her murder of
friends and foes, that Mina was obliged to direct his force
against her. She was surprised, with the greater part of her
banditti, and the whole were shot upon the spot.</p>

<p>Of all the guerilla leaders the two Minas were the most
remarkable for their daring, their talents, and their successes.
The younger, Xavier, had a short career—but nothing could
be more chivalrous and romantic than many of the incidents
that marked it. His band amounted to a thousand—and with
this force he kept Navarre, Biscay, and Aragon in confusion;
intercepted convoys, levied contributions, plundered the custom-houses,
and harassed the enemy incessantly. The villages
were obliged to furnish rations for his troops, and the French
convoys supplied him with money and ammunition. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
escapes were often marvellous.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> He swam flooded rivers deemed
impassable, and climbed precipices hitherto untraversed by a
human foot. Near Estella he was forced by numbers to take
refuge on a lofty rock; the only accessible side he defended
till nightfall, when, lowering himself and followers by a rope,
he brought his party off without the loss of a man.</p>

<p>This was among his last exploits; for, when reconnoitring
by moonlight, in the hope of capturing a valuable convoy, he
fell unexpectedly into the hands of an enemy’s patrol. Proscribed
by the French as a bandit, it was surprising that his
life was spared; but his loss to the guerillas was regarded as a
great misfortune.</p>

<p>While disputing as to the choice of a leader, where so many
aspired to a command to which each could offer an equal claim,
an adventurer worthy to succeed their lost chief was happily
discovered in his uncle, the elder Mina. Educated as a husbandman,
and scarcely able to read or write, the new leader
had lived in great retirement, until the Junta’s call to arms
induced him to join his nephew’s band. He reluctantly
acceded to the general wish to become Xavier’s successor; but
when he assumed the command, his firm and daring character
was rapidly developed. Echeverria, with a strong following,
had started as a rival chief; but Mina surprised him—had
three of his subordinates shot with their leader—and united
the remainder of the band with his own. Although he narrowly
escaped becoming a victim to the treachery of a comrade,
the prompt and severe justice with which he visited the
offender, effectually restrained other adventurers from making
any similar attempt.</p>

<p>The traitor was a sergeant of his own, who, from the bad
expression of his face, had received among his companions the
sobriquet of Malcarado. Discontented with the new commander,
he determined to betray him to the enemy, and concerted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
measures with Pannetti, whose brigade was near the
village of Robres, to surprise the guerilla chieftain in his bed.
Partial success attended the treacherous attempt; but Mina
defended himself desperately with the bar of the door, and
kept the French at bay till Gustra, his chosen comrade,
assisted him to escape. The guerilla rallied his followers,
repulsed the enemy, took Malcarado, and shot him instantly;
while the village cure and three alcades implicated in the
traitorous design, were hanged side by side upon a tree, and
their houses rased to the ground.</p>

<p>An example of severity like this gave confidence to his own
followers, and exacted submission from the peasantry. Every
where Mina had a faithful spy—every movement of the
enemy was reported; and if a village magistrate received a
requisition from a French commandant, it was communicated
to the guerilla chief with due despatch, or woe to the alcade
that neglected it.</p>

<p>Nature had formed Mina<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> for the service to which he had
devoted himself. His constitution was equal to every privation
and fatigue, and his courage was of that prompt and daring
character which no circumstance, however sudden and
disheartening, could overcome. Careless as to dress or food,
he depended for a change of linen on the capture of French
baggage or any accidental supply; and for days he could subsist
on a few biscuits, or any thing chance threw in his way.
He guarded carefully against surprise—slept with a dagger
and pistols in his girdle; and such were his active habits, that
he rarely took more than two hours of repose. Remote
caverns were the depositories of his ammunition and plunder;
and in a mountain fastness he established an hospital for his
wounded, to which they were carried on litters across the
heights, and placed in perfect safety until their cure could be
completed. Gaming and plunder were prohibited, and even
love forbidden, lest the guerilla might be too communicative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
to the object of his affection, and any of his chieftain’s secrets
should thus transpire.</p>

<p>Of the minor chiefs many strange and chivalrous adventures
are on record. The daring plans, often tried and generally
successful, and the hair-breadth escapes of several, are almost
beyond belief. No means, however repugnant to the laws of
modern warfare, were unemployed; while the ingenuity with
which intelligence of a hostile movement was transmitted—the
artifice with which an enemy was delayed, until he could
be surrounded or surprised, appear incredible. Of individual
ferocity a few instances will be sufficient. At the execution
of an alcade and his son at Mondragon, the old man boasted
that two hundred French had perished by their hands; and
the Chaleco, Francis Moreno, in a record of his services,
boasts of his having waited for a cavalry patrol in a ravine,
and by the discharge of a huge blunderbuss, loaded nearly to
the muzzle, dislocated his own shoulder, and killed or wounded
nine of the French. The same chief presented to Villafranca
a rich booty of plate and quicksilver, and added to the gift a
parcel of ears cut from the prisoners whom on that occasion he
had slaughtered.</p>

<p>Profiting by the anarchy that reigned in this afflicted
country, wretches, under political excuses, committed murder
and devastation on a scale of frightful magnitude. One, pretending
to be a functionary of the Junta, made Ladrada a
scene of bloodshed. By night his victims were despatched;
and, to the disgrace of woman, his wife was more sanguinary
than himself. Castanos at length arrested their blood-stained
career; and Pedrazeula was hanged and beheaded, and Maria,
his infamous confederate, gavotted.</p>

<p>Castile was overrun by banditti; and one gang, destroyed
by a guerilla chief named Juan Abril, had accumulated plunder,
principally in specie, amounting in value to half a million
of reals. One of the band, when captured by the French, to
save his life discovered the secret, and offered to lead a party
to the place where the treasure was deposited. His proposal
was accepted. An alguazil, with an escort of cavalry, proceeded
to the wood of Villa Viciosa, and there booty was
found worth more than the value affixed to it by the deserter.
Returning in unsuspecting confidence, the party were drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
into an ambuscade by the Medico, who had been acquainted
with the expedition; and of the escort and officials, with the
exception of five who managed to escape, every one was
butchered without mercy.</p>

<p>Such were the wild and relentless foes to whom the invaders
were exposed—such were the Spaniards, who had made
themselves remarkable for patriotism and endurance—surpassing
courage, and unmitigated cruelty.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_11">OPERATIONS AND OCCURRENCES FROM THE
DEATH OF SIR JOHN MOORE TO THE ARRIVAL
OF SIR ARTHUR WELLESLEY.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Operations of the French.—General Friere murdered.—Defeat of the
Spanish armies.—Siege of Zaragoza.—Operations in Catalonia.—Proceedings
at Lisbon.—Arrival of Sir Arthur Wellesley.—State of the
allied army.—Soult’s dangerous position.</p></blockquote>

<p>Under such unpromising circumstances, which we have
described, intelligence reached Sir John Craddock, that three
French armies were about to move on Portugal; Soult from
Gallicia, Lapisse from Salamanca, and Victor from the Tagus.
In the vicinity of the latter, Cuesta was endeavouring to
organize anew his routed levies: but on his exertions little
dependence could be placed—and when the alarm spread, the
garrison of Almeida was withdrawn, the forts on the Tagus
dismantled, and every preparation was made to embark the
British at Lisbon, and abandon Portugal to her oppressors.</p>

<p>This panic was, however, checked by the preservation of
Almeida and Rodrigo, by Sir Robert Wilson’s Portuguese,
added to some advantages gained by Cuesta’s army over the
French, under Victor. The British force in Lisbon had also
been reinforced—twenty thousand Portuguese were taken into
the pay of England—and all these things restored, in some
degree, a partial confidence.</p>

<p>After the embarkation at Corunna, the French were for a
short time inactive. Ney relieved Soult in Gallicia with
seventeen thousand men, and enabled the latter to advance on
Oporto with twenty-four thousand. After garrisoning Vigo
and Tuy, he attempted to cross the Minho near its mouth—but,
from imperfect means of transport, he was repulsed, and
obliged to march up the river, and pass it by the bridge at
Orense. This movement, though in the first instance unfavourable,
had nearly ended in the destruction of Romana; who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
being surprised and defeated, saved himself only by some
happy accidents from total ruin.</p>

<p>On entering Portugal, the few and ill-disciplined remnants
of the Spanish regiments fell back upon the mountain country,
General Friere prudently adopting a defensive system, rather
venture a combat, for which he knew well that his army was
utterly unprepared. This determination of the Spanish general
was unpopular. Unpractised in the field, without discipline or
formation, and blind to the severe lessons taught them by their
recent defeats, these raw levies were ardent for action, and
clamorous to meet the enemy again. A number of irregulars,
who had lately joined, excited this popular delusion—and they
insisted that, contrary to his own judgment, that their general
should fight. Friere prudently and steadily refused; and his
mutinous soldiers—if such a mob deserve the name—broke
into his quarters, treated him with every ignominy, and finally
murdered himself and most of his staff.</p>

<p>They immediately elected a British <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">employé</i>, Baron Eben,
who commanded a Lusitanian brigade, as their commander;
and, he, unable to control their fancy for fighting, brought
them fairly into action at Carvalho de Este. As might have
been expected from such ruffians, they were completely routed.
Like Falstaff, the Baron had brought his “scoundrels where
they were well peppered,”—and many fell victims to their
stupidity and presumption, in supposing for a moment, that
they could encounter Soult’s veteran troops with the slightest
prospect of success. Oporto was next besieged—and though
the city was garrisoned by twenty thousand men, having two
hundred guns mounted on the works, it was stormed on the
third day. The usual scenes of military license, which the
usage of war permits after a successful assault, were here fearfully
enacted. Soult, however, checked the turbulence of the
soldiery after the first burst of fury had subsided; and on the
next day, order was generally restored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Spanish armies were undergoing a series of
disasters—and Cuesta was driven from the southern frontier,
after suffering a signal defeat. Victor following up his success,
crossed the Tagus at Almaraz, and threw himself on the
Spanish army. The French charge was stoutly withstood—the
cavalry driven back—and, in return, Victor’s left attacked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
and forced for nearly two miles to retire. But it rallied—the
Spanish horse, which had been pursuing, suddenly gave way;
a panic seized the infantry—the whole broke—threw down
their arms,—and endeavoured to save themselves by a precipitous
flight. No quarter was given—upwards of nine thousand
men were bayoneted and cut down—and the Spanish army
was totally disorganized, and placed, for every useful purpose,
completely <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>The army of La Mancha was not more fortunate in an
engagement at Ciudad Real with Sebastiani. Broken at the
first charge, they were hunted off the field, and pursued by
the French cavalry to the very base of the Sierra Morena.
Their guns and three thousand prisoners were the trophies of
a complete <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i>. The number of their killed and wounded
was immense, for the French followed up their success with
unscrupulous severity, cutting down or bayoneting every fugitive
that could be overtaken. No wonder that the French
marshals carried terror with their names; and that the overthrow
of the Spanish legions alarmed their British allies at
Lisbon. Means were adopted for defence, in the event of the
French advancing—a corps was stationed at Abrantes—the
main body at Leria—and the Portuguese under Beresford at
Thomar.</p>

<p>Some other operations of moment had occurred in Arragon
and Catalonia. In Arragon the reduction of Zaragoza was the
next attempt of the French after the fatal fight of Tudela; and
there, a resistance was unexpectedly given by the inhabitants,
that finds no parallel in the annals of war.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> Every effort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
art and labour was exhausted to render the city one huge
fortress; the convent became a barrack; the church an
hospital; woman forgot her fears; the monk left the shrine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
for the battery; every street was retrenched; every building
secured by barricades; and when the external defences were
destroyed, and the walls levelled by the besiegers, the contest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
had to be continued from street to street—and house after
house was as obstinately defended, as if upon its occupation
the fate of Zaragoza hung. Although hunger exhausted their
energies, and pestilence swept the defenders away by thousands,
the stern reply to every summons was “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">guerre a la cuchulo!</i>”
At last, when every street was ruined—when forty thousand
of every sex and age had perished—twelve thousand wretched
men, too much enfeebled to resist, and a ruined heap of shattered
buildings, were the dear-earned trophies that fell to the
conquerors of Europe.</p>

<p>In Catalonia, for a time, the progress of French conquest
was interrupted. St. Cyr, however, advanced with twenty
thousand men, and after a spirited resistance, obliged Rosas to
surrender. Following up his success, the French general
marched and attacked Vives, who had taken up a strong position
defended by a number of guns. Although St. Cyr was
unprovided with cannon—his mountain movement having
obliged him to send his artillery to Figueras—he threw himself
upon the Spanish lines, broke and dispersed them, with
great slaughter, and the loss of the whole of their guns.
Again, at Llobregat, he brought the Spanish general to action,
and the battle terminated with results as ruinous. Vives was
deposed from the command, and Reding succeeded him.</p>

<p>Reding, finding himself in command of thirty thousand men,
decided on acting on the offensive, and moved forward with
his army. This determination was unfortunate. St. Cyr,
availing himself of the great extension of Reding’s force, threw
himself upon its centre, severed the wings, and destroyed their
communication. After vainly endeavouring, by reuniting a
portion of his beaten troops to oppose Souham, Reding was
overtaken by St. Cyr, near Tarragona—again defeated, his
army dispersed, and himself mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Blake succeeded to the chief command on Reding’s death;
and while a detachment of a thousand French was surprised
on the river Cinca by Perena, the Spanish commandant
engaged Suchet with credit, and drove him at night-fall from
the field. This partial victory roused the drooping spirits of
the Spaniards—and Blake moved into Arragon to recapture
Zaragoza from the invaders.</p>

<p>These temporary successes held out little prospect of repelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
invading armies, which were expecting an immense addition
to their force. In fact, Portugal would have been soon
at the mercy of the enemy, and Spain could have offered but
a feeble resistance, when Sir Arthur Wellesley arrived to take
the chief command—or, as many believed, to witness a second
embarkation, and yield Portugal once more to the invaders.</p>

<p>These forebodings were unfounded—nothing was farther
from the intention of Sir Arthur than an abandonment of the
country. He instantly proceeded to adopt measures that
should enable him to take the field, and the army was concentrated,
with the exception of Mackenzie’s brigade, at Coimbra,
and reviewed. The entire numbered twenty-six thousand
men, of which six thousand formed the separate corps under
Marshal Beresford. With the Germans, the English brigades
mustered about seventeen thousand; the detached corps under
Mackenzie, amounting to nearly three thousand, of which one
half was cavalry; and a farther augmentation was effected by
brigading one Portuguese, with every two of the British battalions.</p>

<p>A strong division—Mackenzie’s brigades—with Portuguese
regiments amounting to twelve thousand men, were posted at
Santarem and Abrantes. This corps was intended to secure
Lisbon, should Victor prefer marching on the capital by Alentejo,
rather than proceed with his army into Andalusia.</p>

<p>In the mean time Soult’s position became extremely dangerous.—A
British army in his front—bands of guerillas in his
rear; one flank hemmed in by Silviera at Amarante; and the
ocean on the other. But that able marshal perceived the difficulties
of his situation, and deciding at once to secure an open
road in his rear, he despatched Delaborde and Loison to
recover Amarante. The task was a tedious and doubtful
operation; and for twelve days the place was assaulted and
maintained.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> At last, Soult in person came forward in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
strength—and Silviera was driven from the bridge over the
Tamaga, with the loss of his cannon,—and the French retreat
was for the present secured.</p>

<p>But two courses remained for the duke of Dalmatia to
adopt—to move towards Victor, by circuitous marches on the
Tagus—or, what was far more probable, retire from Portugal
by the road leading through the Tras os Montes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_12">PASSAGE OF THE DOURO.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>First movements of the Allies.—Affairs with French cavalry and rear-guard.—Passage
of the Douro.—Soult’s disorderly retreat.—French
suffer heavily.—Wellesley moves to the south, and communicates with
Cuesta.—Combined movement planned.—Cuesta’s imbecility mars it.—Victor
escapes.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the moment Sir Arthur Wellesley landed in Portugal,
the character of the war had changed; and, notwithstanding
the numerous and discouraging drawbacks upon a bold
career which the obstinacy of the Spaniards and the deficiency
of his own means were continually presenting, before the masterly
decision of the British general, all obstacles ultimately
gave way; and victory, which had hovered doubtfully over
many a hard-contested field, at last rested on his banners, and
wreathed her laurels round his brows.</p>

<p>Never had a triumphant campaign a bolder or more brilliant
opening. On the 7th of May, the cavalry brigade, under
General Cotton, marched on the Oporto road, followed by the
remainder of the army in three divisions; those of generals
Paget and Payne moving towards Vouga; and the third,
under General Hill, advancing on Aveira. The movements
were slowly executed, to allow Marshal Beresford time to
reach his destination, and seize the bridge of Amarante, before
a British force should display itself in front of Oporto.</p>

<p>These plans of Sir Arthur Wellesley were ably effected by
the officers in command. While Beresford was marching with
all expedition on the Upper Douro, Hill, on the night of the
9th, passed a brigade in fishing-boats across the lake, and at
dawn of day landed it safely at Ovar, turning the right flank
of the French; while Beresford, having joined Wilson, drove
Loison’s corps to Amarante, and turned their left. Sir Arthur
hoped to have taken Franchesci, who commanded the French
cavalry division at Abegeria Nova, by surprise; but a country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
difficult to traverse, and accidental delays in transporting the
guns through the pass of Vouga, prolonged the march. When
the cavalry, under Cotton, came in sight of the enemy in the
morning, they found him perfectly prepared, and in an excellent
position—his cavalry in line upon a level plain—their
flank resting on a pine wood occupied by a body of tirailleurs.
General Cotton halted and formed in their front—and in this
attitude, Sir Arthur found the French and his own advanced
guard.</p>

<p>The infantry having now arrived, the wood was cleared of
its sharpshooters, and dispositions made for bringing the
cavalry to action; but Franchesci, though quickly pursued,
succeeded in retreating—abandoning the position to the
British, and by a night march uniting himself to Mermet,
whom he joined at Grijon.</p>

<p>Here, Sir Arthur found them on the 11th, posted strongly
on some high grounds behind the village, and to all appearance,
determined to hold them. In a rapid survey of the
position, the British general perceived that the left could be
turned; and although the column never halted, the necessary
manœuvres were effected by detaching General Murray on the
right from the rear of the advanced guard, and throwing a
Portuguese regiment into a pine wood on the left, to amuse
the attention of the enemy, while General Paget threatened
them in front. For a short time a heavy firing was maintained,
but, on the flank movement being discovered, the
French instantly abandoned the position and retreated. The
British were as promptly thrown into column again, and the
march resumed, as if nothing had happened, and every movement
had been that of a field-day.</p>

<p>A brilliant cavalry affair succeeded. On topping the
heights from which the French had been forced, their rear
was seen retiring in confusion, and General Stuart volunteered
to charge with a few troops of hussars that were fortunately at
hand. The attack was made in sections. The British cavalry
galloped down the road, overturned all that opposed them, and
made above one hundred prisoners. Nothing could check
their daring gallantry, until the French infantry were halted
on a height commanding the road. Although unable to face
the fire of a force so posted as those were who held Carvalhos,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
the squadrons wheeled boldly to the right, and threatened the
left of the enemy. Dreading lest they should be overtaken
and outflanked, the French instantly gave up the hill, and
continued retiring rapidly.</p>

<p>The march commenced at nine in the morning—and at five
the troops halted for the night, having had their advanced
guard almost constantly engaged. This, however, never
checked the movement of the columns, and the division occupied
the ground the French had left—Sir Arthur supping in
the convent of Grijon with his staff. It must have been
indeed a busy day with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">religieux</i>—for four generals,
Delaborde, Thomieres, Mermet, and Franchesci, had favoured
them with their company at breakfast.</p>

<p>All went on favourably; Hill had landed at Ovar—Cameron
came up—and both were in communication. Though
holding better ground, the enemy had in every attack been
driven back. Yet they had fought gallantly, and it was
encouraging to British soldiers to find that they had fairly met
the best troops in Europe, and as fairly beaten them.</p>

<p>Next morning the march was renewed. Soult avoided any
collision, retreated over the Douro, destroyed the bridge, and
carried every boat that could swim to the other bank, and
there effectually secured them.</p>

<p>This was a critical moment—and in a more dangerous
position a British general never found himself. A broad and
rapid river separated the allies from the enemy, and no means
of passing it could be discovered. Soult might retire unmolested
into Gallicia if he pleased, or attack Beresford singly,
overpower him by superior force, and enter Beira. Danger
often stimulates bravery to startling but successful enterprises;
and in this emergency Wellesley decided on as bold an effort
as modern warfare parallels,—the crossing of the Douro.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a daring and a perilous attempt; a strong
force was on the other bank; the shores were steep and rocky,
and the stream three hundred yards across. Every means
had been taken by Soult to make the passage impracticable.
His generals of brigade were in observation on the banks;
every point of passage was defended; while the marshal satisfied
himself that the bridge was utterly destroyed, as he
watched from midnight till daybreak the burning pontoons as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
they went floating down the current. The only practicable
plan that seemed left for Sir Arthur to adopt was to employ
the shipping, and land his troops at the débouchement of the
Douro; and, in that belief, the French general retired to his
head-quarters, from which he could observe the sea—and, as
he expected, watch the disembarkation.</p>

<p>Wellesley, aware how dangerously Marshal Beresford was
situated, had determined at every hazard to cross the river,
and arrangements were instantly made. General Murray was
despatched to Avintes to try the ford, and if boats could be
found, to send them down the stream,—the Guards, under
General Sherbrooke, were detached to attempt the ferry below
the town;—while, from the convent of Santo Agostinho, the
British commander directed the main operations in person.
A spot was marked on the opposite shore as a favourable
place for landing. It was an unfinished building near the
bank, and there, the troops first passed over were directed to
establish themselves until assistance reached them. To cover
this landing-place some guns were quietly got into battery in
the convent garden. Every preparation was made—and a
fortunate accident obtained the means of passage.</p>

<p>A small skiff was discovered hidden in some high rushes,
that had concealed it from the French. A few peasants and
a Portuguese colonel crossed over, and found some three or
four crazy barges, half buried in the mud. These prizes were
instantly secured. Three companies of the Buffs jumped in,
accompanied by General Paget. The opposite bank was
gained,—the dismantled building garrisoned,—and the barges
were returning for a fresh detachment, before the French
seemed aware of the attempt, and—as it turned out—when it
was too late to repel it.</p>

<p>The enemy came down in force, but the Buffs held the
building they occupied against overwhelming odds. General
Paget was wounded—but fresh companies were ferried over,
and General Hill took charge of the troops. The French
came on in columns, but the batteries from the Serra convent
annoyed them with a plunging fire, while the troops from the
building kept up a well-directed fusilade. Murray, who had
found little difficulty, and succeeded in passing his division
by the ford, now appeared moving rapidly on the left flank of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the French—while Sherbrooke, having obtained some boats,
was ferrying the Guards over below the town. Finding himself
likely to be turned on either side, Soult hastily retreated
by the Amarante road, boldly followed by the British cavalry,
who charged repeatedly with most brilliant success. Evening
ended the pursuit—the brigades occupied the city in every
place—they were cheered by loud vivas, and most affectionately
received by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The crossing of the Douro was, in military estimation, as
bold and well-arranged an operation as any that marked Wellesley’s
Peninsular career. The passage of a river in the face
of an enemy with every assistance from pontoons and ferryage,
is considered a hazardous undertaking; but, circumstanced as
the British commander was, the thing was generally set down
as impracticable, and Soult was unprepared for the attempt.
When the news was brought that the enemy was crossing at
Villa Nova, the marshal ridiculed the notion, and remained
in his quarters until two in the afternoon. He was then
obliged precipitately to quit the city; and so suddenly were
Wellesley’s measures executed, that the dinner prepared for
the duke of Dalmatia, was served up to the British general
and his staff. War is, certes, a game of chances;—and little
did the French marshal suppose, when at noon he regulated
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte</i> presented by his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</i>, that he was then
civilly arranging an excellent repast for his opponent. Yet
such was the case. Wellesley succeeded Soult—and within a
few hours the same roof covered the victor and the vanquished.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the irregularity of the French retreat.
Before they could be persuaded that the passage of the Douro
was seriously designed, the British were charging through the
suburbs; and instead of retiring with an orderly formation on
the advance of the enemy, the French rear-guard got mobbed
together on the road, and allowed an opportunity to the
cavalry of their pursuers to act with an audacity and success
that the weakness of their squadrons could never have warranted,
had not a considerable panic been previously occasioned,
by the precipitation with which Soult’s divisions were
hurried from the city. Night came most opportunely, and
ended the pursuit,—enabling the French marshal to unite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
himself with Loison, from whom he received the unwelcome
intelligence that the bridge of Amarante was destroyed.
Soult’s situation was almost desperate; his only line of retreat
was by a mountain track; and, by taking it, he was obliged
to cross the pass of Ruivans, a long narrow bridge, without a
parapet on either side, spanning a frightful precipice. Should
this be occupied,—and no doubt Beresford was marching
thither,—nothing could save his army. With excellent judgment,
he abandoned his artillery and baggage, pushed rapidly
forward, and, having forced the Portuguese pickets which
here and there occupied the mountain passes, he out-marched
Silviera by several hours, and halted his rear-guard at Salamonde,
to cover the bridges of Saltador and Porto Nova,
while his columns were defiling.</p>

<p>Here, however, he was overtaken and brought to action, on
the 16th, by Sir Arthur. Although the position was strong,
and the brigade of Guards were the only infantry come up,
the British general instantly made his dispositions for attack.
The left was turned by the rifle corps—the Guards advancing
boldly in front. After delivering a volley at the head of the
column when it shewed itself, the French precipitately fled—and,
hurrying through the village in their rear, succeeded,
under cover of the darkness, in escaping. Some delay in clearing
a defile, allowed the horse artillery to come up—and their
rapid fire did considerable execution before the crowd of fugitives
could get beyond its range.</p>

<p>The next morning’s dawn renewed the pursuit; and every
turn of the road, cumbered with broken vehicles and deserted
baggage, shewed how severely the French army had been
pressed. The bridge was nearly impassable from dead men
and slain horses laid there in heaps by the grape and canister
of the British guns. Arms, accoutrements, ham-strung mules,
guns, tumbrils, knapsacks filled with silver plate, tapestry,
and other valuable plunder, were strewn indiscriminately
along the line. To add to this scene of waste and suffering,
the villages the advancing army entered were either in a
blaze, or already reduced to ashes; for between the French
troops and peasantry a deadly war of extermination was
being carried on—and on both sides, deeds of cruelty were
every day perpetrated, that can hardly be credited or described.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Indeed, the French retreat through the Gallician mountains
was only paralleled by the British on Corunna; with this
exception, that many a straggler from the British columns
was saved by the humanity of the Spaniards, while the
unhappy Frenchman who lagged but a few hundred yards
behind the rear-guard, was butchered by the infuriated
peasantry, bent on the work of slaughter and burning for
vengeance on an enemy, who, in his day of conquest and
dominion, had taught the lesson of cruelty now practised so
unrelentingly on himself.</p>

<p>Soult turning from Montalegre towards Orense, and a
French corps from Estremadura having moved on Alcantara,
induced Sir Arthur Wellesley to discontinue the pursuit. The
French marshal crossed the frontier on the 18th with barely
nineteen thousand men—his guns, stores, and baggage abandoned
to the conquerors. Ten weeks, perfect in every arm,
that army had passed through Orense on its march to Oporto,
mustering twenty-six thousand veteran soldiers. A short
period had wrought a fearful change—and even the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> of
that once splendid corps was only extricated from total destruction
by the admirable tact and unbending <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hardiesse</i> of their
brave and gifted leader.</p>

<p>It was indeed full time for the British leader to move southward.
Victor, joined by the division of Lapisse, had, after a
splendid resistance from a Portuguese corps under Colonel
Mayne, forced the passage of the Tagus at Alcantara, and
threatened Lisbon. After a few forward movements, learning
that Soult was retreating, Victor fell back himself to Merida,
detached a division to observe the bridge of Almarez, and
fixed his head-quarters at Torremocha.</p>

<p>By easy marches, Sir Arthur reached the Douro on the
7th. His army was in a bad condition, suffering alike from
their past fatigues in Gallicia, and a total want of every necessary
and comfort. The country was unable to supply him,
and he had no means to procure by land or water carriage,
assistance from his own commissariate. The hospitals were
crowded—officers and men were without pay, provisions, or
even shoes. Still, though disappointed in remittances, and
unable to support his army with any regard to their comforts,
the troops had the most implicit confidence in their leader, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
very justly ascribed the privations they endured to causes
over which their general had no control. The spirit of the
army was still unbroken—and much as its physical strength
might have deteriorated since it marched from Coimbra to
attack Soult, its gallantry was undiminished, and its desire to
meet the enemy as ardent as it had been ever.</p>

<p>Spanish affairs, considered generally, had also assumed a
more favourable appearance; and although the French force in
Spain was still immense, there being within the Pyrenees one
hundred and fifty thousand men, the reverses Napoleon had
encountered at Wagram, and the threatening aspect of affairs
in Germany, precluded any chance that his lieutenants on the
Peninsula would be further reinforced. Hence a spirit of
reaction was encouraged in the Spaniards, accompanied by a
reasonable prospect of success.</p>

<p>On reaching Abrantes on the 7th, it was correctly ascertained
that, instead of retiring on Madrid, Victor was concentrating
at Merida, intending, probably, to cross the Guadiana, and
attack Cuesta before the British could come to his assistance.
Propositions therefore for a combined movement were made by
Sir Arthur Wellesley to the “Spanish general,” and willingly
acceded to—and the British moved forward to the Teitar, to
unite, as it was believed, in an operation upon Madrid.</p>

<p>A most able plan for marching at once for the recovery of
the capital was arranged at a conference between the allied
commanders.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> The British and Spanish armies, taking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
right bank of the Tagus, were to advance directly forward.
Venegas, with fourteen thousand Spaniards, was to threaten
Aranjuez, and, if possible, take possession of Toledo; while
two other Spanish divisions should hold the passes of Banos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and Perales; and five thousand Portuguese, under Sir Robert
Wilson, were to act independently, and annoy the French
flanks and rear as they best could.</p>

<p>The British consequently moved by Salvatiera and Placentia,
effecting a junction with Cuesta at Oropesa on the 20th of
July. On the 22nd Victor had retired and taken a position
on the Alberche. The opportunity was at once given for
attacking him, but Cuesta obstinately declined; and Victor,
hearing that Wilson was already in his rear at Escalona, made
a night march on Torrijos.</p>

<p>Cuesta was a singular medley of opposite qualities. He was
exceedingly brave—had some daring—overweening pride—and
a most asinine obstinacy. Finding it desirable for the prosperity
of the common cause to submit to the old man’s folly,
Sir Arthur Wellesley acted with singular forbearance. It had
been arranged that Victor should be attacked on the 23rd—and
when the British general reached his confederate’s quarters to
arrange the necessary details on the evening of the 22nd,
Cuesta was asleep, and no one dared to waken him. At dawn,
the British divisions were under arms, but Cuesta could not be
disturbed till seven! At last an interview did take place—and
then the weak old man positively declined to fight, because the
day was <em>Sunday</em>. Victor had but twenty thousand men with
him at the moment. The Alberche was fordable—the right
and centre assailable: Cuesta’s army numbered forty-seven
thousand, and Wellesley’s about twenty-one. Was ever such
an opportunity lost?—and all, too, through the stupid bigotry
of a sleepy-headed Spaniard.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Meanwhile the great scarcity of provisions obliged the
British to halt for a day or two, and Wellesley, to obtain supplies,
took a position behind the Alberche.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_13">TALAVERA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Cuesta attacked by Victor—Saved by the division of British Guards.—Position
selected by Lord Wellington.—Battle of Talavera.—Light
regiments join the army by a forced march.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Sir Arthur halted at Talavera, having two divisions
across the river at Casa Leguas, Cuesta followed the French,
who as he persuaded himself were retreating—but Sebastiani
had marched from Toledo and joined Victor, while Joseph
Buonaparte, having united his corps to Jourdan’s, was hastening
to a common centre. The whole united at Torrijos, forming
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> of nearly fifty thousand men.</p>

<p>Cuesta, with all his Spanish obstinacy, would still insist that
the French were not concentrating, but retreating,—but the
delusion was short. Victor suddenly attacked him—and as his
retreat was most disorderly, nothing but prompt assistance
from Sherbrooke’s division could have saved the stupid old man
from destruction. When this was effected, the Guards crossed
the river, leaving Mackenzie’s division in possession of the wood
and convent on the right bank of the Alberche.</p>

<p>A recent deliverance seemed to have had no effect upon
Spanish obstinacy. Though certain of being attacked, Cuesta
lay loosely on the Alberche, into which, had his army been
defeated, it must have been driven pell-mell. Happily, Sir
Arthur, in reconnoitring the ground in the neighbourhood, discovered
an extensive line on which both armies might be placed
to their mutual advantage. “He took his measures with such
promptitude, and issued his orders with such coolness and perspicuity,
that every battalion, Spanish as well as English,
stepped into the very spot which his admirable foresight had
marked out for it.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
The position was about two miles in length, extending perpendicularly
from the Tagus, on which the right rested in the
town of Talavera. It was partially retrenched, having an intersected
and most difficult country in its front. The centre
was more open; but the left terminated favourably on a bold
and commanding height, overlooking a considerable valley,
which separated the left of the position from a range of rocky
mountains. To the Spaniards the right was allotted, it being
considered nearly unattackable—while the British defended the
more accessible ground upon the left.</p>

<p>Talavera stands on the northern bank of the Tagus, the
houses reaching down to the water’s edge. The two armies
were drawn up in line; the British on the left, extending from
the town nearly to the Sierra de Gata, its extreme flank occupying
a bold height near Alatuza de Segusella, and having in
its front a difficult ravine, and on its flank a deep valley. To
the Spaniards the right was assigned. Their battalions were
stationed among olive groves, with walls and fences interspersed,
and an embankment running along the road, that
formed an excellent breastwork, and rendered their position
nearly unassailable. It was necessary to secure the point of
junction where the British right touched Cuesta’s left,—and,
to effect this, ten guns were placed in battery on the summit
of a bold knoll, with an English division to protect them, and
a strong cavalry corps in reserve. In the general disposition
of the troops, Campbell’s division was on the right of the British,
Sherbrooke’s division adjoining; Mackenzie occupied the
next portion of the battle-ground,—while the height upon the
left—the key of the position, was intrusted to General Hill.</p>

<p>During the morning, the troops had been marching on the
different points marked for their occupation, and had taken
ground hitherto unmolested by the enemy; but at noon Mackenzie’s
division was suddenly and furiously assailed by two
heavy columns, which attacked the wood and convent. Partially
surprised, the 87th and 88th regiments were thrown into
a momentary confusion;<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> and the French penetrated between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
the two brigades which formed the division. Immediately, by
the exertions of their officers, the 31st, 45th, and 60th rifles
were brought forward, and these regiments covered their companions,
while they retired from the wood into the plain,
retreating in beautiful order along the heights on the left of the
position which they were directed to occupy.</p>

<p>The enemy continued their attack, and it had now extended
partially along the whole line, growing more animated as the
evening began to fall. The left, where the British stood, at
once appeared the grand object of the marshals.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> They
directed a strong force against it, forming their infantry into
columns of battalions, which advanced in double quick, supported
by a furious cannonade.</p>

<p>Mackenzie’s division having retired a little, and, at the
moment, forming a second line, the brunt of the assault fell
upon a smaller brigade under General Donkin, then in possession
of the height. The French, though they came on with
imposing bravery, were checked in front; but from the weakness
of his brigade, Donkin’s flank was turned on the left, and
the hill behind crowned by the enemy.</p>

<p>But that success was momentary. Hill instantly led up the
48th, 29th, and 1st battalion of detachments. A close and
murderous volley from the British was followed by a charge.
The French were forced from the position with great loss;
and the ridge was again carried by a wing of the 29th with
the bayonet.</p>

<p>There was a brief space of quiet; but determined to win
the key of the position, though darkness had now set in, the
French in great force once more rushed forward to wrest the
height from its defenders—and in the gloom the assailants and
the assailed nearly touched each other. The red flash of a
well-delivered volley disclosed to the English the dark array
that threatened them. The order was given to advance,—and
again the British bayonet drove the columns down the hill.</p>

<p>No fighting could have been more desperate than that which
marked this night attack. A feint had been made by Lapisse
upon the Germans in the centre, while, with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
infantry, Ruffin and Vilatte ascended the heights, which, at
every loss, they seemed more resolute in winning. A terrific
slaughter ensued. Could it be otherwise? So desperately
was this night fighting maintained, and the regiments were so
closely engaged, that in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>, some of the men fought
with clubbed muskets.</p>

<p>These signal repulses of a powerful and gallant enemy
could not but cost a heavy expenditure of blood. Many brave
officers had fallen—and at this period of the conflict, the killed
and wounded amounted to upwards of eight hundred men.</p>

<p>The troops rested upon their arms—and each battalion on
the ground it had occupied the preceding day. The cavalry
were stretched beside their horses; all were ready for an attack;
but the night passed with some slight alarms, and no
serious disturbance.</p>

<p>The morning was ushered in by a tremendous cannonade,
while the grenadiers of Lapisse’s division, in two columns,
advanced again to attack the height upon the left. They were
bravely led forward by their officers, and made many desperate
but unavailing efforts to win the summit of the hill—but
nothing could shake the firmness of the British. They
allowed the columns to mount the rugged ascent, until they
had nearly touched the ridge,—then, a close volley, a loud
huzza, followed by a rapid charge, broke the formation of the
French, and sent them precipitously down the hill. Again
and again the attempt was made with equal ill fortune; until,
totally disheartened by repeated repulses and leaving the
ground heaped with dead, the enemy abandoned all hope of
carrying this well-defended position, and retreated out of fire.</p>

<p>It was now half-past eight, and the fighting had never intermitted
from five that morning. The loss on both sides was
frightful; the French infinitely greater than the British.
Their repeated attacks on the height occasioned immense loss;
and their troops, dispirited by want of success, and wearied
by constant but unavailing exertion, showed little inclination
to renew the battle.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun had become intolerable—and the movements,
on the French part, were stayed. Indeed, the firing
had ceased over the field—and the work of slaughter, by a
sort of mutual consent, was for a time suspended. The French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
commenced cooking their dinners, and the English and their
allies produced their scantier rations. During this temporary
cessation of hostilities, it was a matter of some deliberation
with the British commander, whether in turn he should
become the assailant, or remain quietly and await the result
of the enemy’s decision; and it was a fortunate circumstance
that the latter was his determination.</p>

<p>At this time a curious incident occurred, that for a brief
space changed the character of the war, and, even on a battle-field
covered with the dead and dying, produced a display of
kindly feeling between two brave and noble-minded enemies.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
“A small stream, tributary to the Tagus, flowed through
a part of the battle-ground, and separated the combatants.
During the pause that the heat of the weather and the weariness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of the troops had produced, both armies went to the banks
of the rivulet for water. The men approached each other
fearlessly, threw down their caps and muskets, chatted to each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
other like old acquaintances, and exchanged their brandy-flasks
and wine-skins. All asperity of feeling seemed forgotten.
To a stranger they would have appeared more like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
an allied force, than men hot from a ferocious conflict, and
only gathering strength and energy to recommence it anew.
But a still nobler rivalry for the time existed; the interval
was employed in carrying off the wounded, who lay intermixed
upon the hard-contested field; and, to the honour of
both be it told, that each endeavoured to extricate the common
sufferers, and remove their unfortunate friends and enemies,
without distinction. Suddenly, the bugles sounded, the
drums beat to arms,—many of the rival soldiery shook hands,
and parted with expressions of mutual esteem, and in ten minutes
after they were again at the bayonet’s point.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>Having ascertained the part of the position, and the extent
of it that was occupied by the English brigades, the marshals
determined to direct their undivided energies against that portion
of the line, and, if possible, crush the British divisions
by bearing on them with an overwhelming force. They
formed in four columns of attack: the first was destined against
that part of the ground where the British and Spaniards
united; the second against Sherbrooke and Cameron’s brigades;
the third was directed against Mackenzie’s and the
Germans; and the fourth, in great strength, and accompanied
by a mass of cavalry, moved up the valley to the left.</p>

<p>A fire from eighty pieces of artillery<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> announced the forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
movement of the columns, which soon presented themselves,
covered by a cloud of light infantry. A destructive
cannonade was borne by the English brigades patiently—in
vain the tirailleurs kept up a biting fire—but not a shot was
returned by the British. Their orders to reserve their fire
were strictly obeyed, and the files steadily and quietly closed
up, for the men were falling by dozens. Their assailants
approached,—their officers called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">En avant!</i>” and the drums
beat the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pas de charge</i>. Nothing could be more imposing
than the advance,—nothing more complete than their discomfiture.
Within twenty paces a shattering volley was delivered
from the English line,—the word “<em>Charge!</em>” was given—and
the bayonet did the rest.</p>

<p>Campbell’s division, on the right, totally defeated the
attack, and charging boldly in return, drove the French back,
and captured a battery of ten guns. The enemy endeavoured
to retake them, but the Spanish cavalry charged home—the
cannon remained with the captors, and the right of the British
was victorious every where.</p>

<p>The left attack failed totally. The British cavalry were
posted in the valley where the hostile movement was being
made; and Anson’s brigade, consisting of the 23rd light
dragoons, and the 1st King’s German hussars, were ordered
to charge and check the advance. It was gallantly attempted,—and
though in point of fact the charge failed, and the 23rd
were nearly cut to pieces, the daring courage exhibited under
circumstances perfectly desperate, so completely astounded
the enemy, that their attack on the height was abandoned.
If there was an error in the mode that charge was made, it
arose from its fearless gallantry; and under common circumstances,
its result would have been most glorious. Colonel
Napier thus describes the affair:</p>

<p>“The ground upon which this brigade was in line is perfectly
level, nor did any visible obstruction appear between it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and the columns opposed. The grass was long, dry, and waving,
concealing the fatal chasm that intervened. One of
General Villatte’s columns stood at some distance to the right
of the building occupied by the light troops. These were
directly in front of the 23rd dragoons. Another was formed
rather to the rear, and more in front of the German hussars,
on the left of the line. Such were the immediate objects of
the charge.</p>

<p>“For some time the brigade advanced at a rapid pace,
without receiving any obstruction from the enemy’s fire. The
line cheered. It was answered from the hill with the greatest
enthusiasm; never was any thing more exhilarating or more
beautiful than the commencement of this advance. Several
lengths in front, mounted on a grey horse, consequently very
conspicuous, rode Colonel Elley. Thus placed, he, of course,
first arrived at the brink of a ravine, which, varying in width,
extended along the whole front of the line. Going half-speed
at the time, no alternative was left him. To have checked
his horse, and given timely warning, would have been impossible.
With some difficulty he cleared it at a bound, and on
gaining the opposite bank, endeavoured by gesture to warn
the 23rd of the dangerous ground they had to pass; but
advancing with such velocity, the line was on the verge of the
stream, before his signs could be either understood or attended
to. Under any circumstances this must have been a serious
occurrence in a cavalry charge; but when it is considered that
four or five hundred dragoons were assailing two divisions of
infantry, unbroken, and fully prepared for the onset, to have
persevered at all was highly honourable to the regiment.</p>

<p>“At this moment the enemy, formed in squares, opened
his tremendous fire. A change immediately took place.
Horses rolled on the earth; others were seen flying back
dragging their unhorsed riders with them; the German hussars
coolly reined up; the line of the 23rd was broken. Still the
regiment galloped forward. The confusion was increased;
but no hesitation took place in the individuals of this gallant
corps. The survivors rushed forward with, if possible,
accelerated pace, passing between the flank of the square,
now one general blaze of fire, and the building on its left.”</p>

<p>Still the remainder of the 23rd, led on by Major Ponsonby,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
passing under this withering fire, assailed and overthrew a
regiment of chasseurs; and, though attacked in turn by a
squadron of Westphalian horse, and some Polish lancers, it
cut its way through these, and riding past the intervals of the
infantry, reached the base of the mountain, where the Spanish
corps of observation secured it. Its loss was awful. In an
affair that lasted but a few minutes, nine officers, twelve sergeants,
two hundred rank and file, and two hundred and
twenty-four horses, were rendered <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>On the centre, the attack was made with great steadiness
and determination. The French columns deployed before
they attempted to ascend the heights, and, regardless of broken
ground, advanced to the charge with imposing gallantry.
General Sherbrooke, having fully prepared his men, received
them with a volley of musketry, which staggered their resolution,
and the whole division rushing forward with the bayonet,
the French were driven back with prodigious loss. But the
Guards came loosely on. The French observed it; perceived
an opening in the line, and threw in a tremendous fire on the
Germans, that caused a momentary confusion. The affair is
thus narrated by an officer of the 48th. The celerity with
which a mistake, that to other troops might have proved fatal,
was remedied by the coolness of the commander and the
heroism of his army, could never be better exemplified.</p>

<p>“At this period of the battle, and in nearly their last
attempt, the enemy had been repulsed and followed. The
Guards, carried onwards by victorious excitement, advanced
too far, and found themselves assailed by the French reserve,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
and mowed down by an overwhelming fire. They fell back,
but as whole sections were swept away their ranks became disordered,
and nothing but their stubborn gallantry prevented a
total <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i>. Their situation was most critical,—had the
French cavalry charged home, nothing could have saved
them. Lord Wellington saw the danger, and speedily despatched
support. A brigade of horse was ordered up, and
our regiment moved from the heights we occupied to assist
our hard-pressed comrades. We came on at double-quick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
and formed in the rear by companies, and through the intervals
in our line the broken ranks of the Guards retreated.
A close and well-directed volley from us arrested the progress
of the victorious French, while with amazing celerity and
coolness, the Guards rallied and reformed, and in a few
minutes advanced in turn to support us. As they came on,
the men gave a loud huzza. An Irish regiment to the right
answered it with a thrilling cheer. It was taken up from
regiment to regiment, and passed along the English line; and
that wild shout told the advancing enemy that British valour
was indomitable. The leading files of the French halted—turned—fell
back—and never made another effort.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>In every place the British were victorious—and had one
forward movement of the Spaniards been made, Talavera
would have proved the most decisive defeat that ever the
French armies on the Peninsula had sustained—for a rapid
flanking march from Cuesta’s right upon the Alberche must
have compromised half the French army. But with troops
so wretchedly disciplined it was impossible to change any
previous formation in face of an enemy: and thus the French
marshals were enabled to retreat in perfect order, with the
greater portion of their baggage, the whole of their wounded,
and all their artillery, with the exception of ten guns taken
by Campbell’s brigade, and seven abandoned in the woods, and
afterwards secured.</p>

<p>As victory is ever damped by individual suffering, an event
well calculated to increase the horrors of a battle-field occurred,
that cannot be recollected without the liveliest sorrow for
those who suffered.</p>

<p>From the heat of the weather, the fallen leaves were parched
like tinder, and the grass was rank and dry. Near the end
of the engagement both were ignited by the blaze of some
cartridge-papers, and the whole surface of the ground was
presently covered with a sheet of fire. Those of the disabled
who lay on the outskirts of the field managed to crawl away,
or were carried off by their more fortunate companions who
had escaped unhurt; but, unhappily, many gallant sufferers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
with “medicable wounds,” perished in the flames before it was
possible to extricate them.</p>

<p>The battle was ended at about six o’clock, and after that
hour scarcely a shot was heard. Both armies occupied the
positions of the morning, and the British bivouacked on the
field, with little food and no shelter; while the dead lay
silently around, and the moans of the wounded broke sadly on
the ear, as they were conveyed all through the night to the
hospitals in Salamanca.</p>

<p>The French were evidently about to retire—but, from a
great inferiority in cavalry, pursuit was impossible. On the
next morning, two of their divisions only were seen beyond
the river, and these retreated on the night of the 31st, and
followed the remainder of the beaten <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i>.</p>

<p>The British loss was extremely severe—and from the heavy
cannonade, regiments not otherwise exposed, suffered much.
The whole force, exclusive of the Spaniards, did not exceed
nineteen thousand, and of these fully four thousand men were
killed and wounded. The Spanish loss was inconsiderable, as
they were never seriously engaged—not reaching altogether
to a thousand <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>The casualties of Joseph Buonaparte’s army it would be difficult
to ascertain with any thing like correctness. It has been
stated at six, eight, and even ten thousand. The intermediate
estimate would probably be the truest—and certainly the
French loss exceeded the allied by a third if not a half.</p>

<p>On the morning after the battle, the light brigade were
reinforced by three splendid regiments, the 43rd, 52nd, and
95th, under General Craufurd, who reached the army accompanied
by a troop of horse artillery. Its march was remarkable,—sixty-three
English miles were accomplished in twenty-seven
hours.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Advancing under a burning sun, over a sandy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
country, badly supplied with water, with bad rations and
scarcely any bread, the movement was extraordinary. When
the weight a soldier in heavy marching order carries is considered,
the distance these splendid regiments achieved was
certainly a surprising effort.</p>

<p>Aware that the armies were in presence of each other, and
apprised that a battle was inevitable, an ardent wish to share
the glory of the field stimulated these soldiers to exertions
that hunger, fatigue, and thirst could not abate; and though
efforts almost beyond belief failed to bring them to the battle-ground
before the struggle terminated, the rapidity of their
march, and the fine condition in which they joined the army,
justly obtained for them the admiration of the victors of
Talavera.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_14">OPERATIONS FROM THE BATTLE OF TALAVERA
TO THE AFFAIR OF THE COA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Movements of Soult and Wellington.—Wilson’s affair at Banos.—Defeats
of the Spanish armies.—Fall of Gerona and Hostalrich.—Rodrigo
besieged, and capitulates.—Julian Sanchez.—Unfortunate attempt by
Craufurd.—Probable movements of Massena.</p></blockquote>

<p>Soult, who had collected thirty-five thousand men, on learning
the defeat of Talavera, made a flank movement to assist
Joseph Buonaparte, and reached Placentia by the pass of
Banos. Lord Wellington, on being apprised of the French
marshal’s advance, instantly determined to march forward and
engage him; while Cuesta observed the line of the Tagus, and
protected the stores and hospitals at Talavera. Accordingly,
on the 3rd of August, the British moved to Orapesa; but on
that evening information was received that Soult had cut off
Lord Wellington’s communication with the bridge of Almarez,
and that Cuesta was about to evacuate Talavera. This
intelligence made an immediate change in Lord Wellington’s
plans indispensable,—and it became necessary to cross the
Tagus instantly. A passage was effected by the bridge of
Arzabispo,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> and the whole artillery and stores were safely
brought off, over horrible roads, which hitherto had been
deemed impracticable for any thing but mules and the rude
carriages of the country. After a short stay, the British fell
back on Badajoz, early in September.</p>

<p>Cuesta’s sudden retreat from Talavera had not only endangered
Lord Wellington, but nearly caused the total destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
of the Portuguese corps, commanded by Sir Robert Wilson.
In obedience to orders, Sir Robert had advanced within twelve
miles of the capital before he was recalled—and after narrowly
escaping the French armies, by the ill-judged retirement of
the Spanish general from Talavera, he found himself completely
cut off from the Tagus. With considerable difficulty,
the Portuguese general crossed the Sierra de Llana, and seized
the pass of Banos, whither Soult, on falling back from Placentia
to Leon, was rapidly advancing,—nothing remaining
for him but to defend the pass, and risk a battle with numbers
immensely superior to his own. This determination was
gallantly carried into effect. After a desperate resistance of
nine hours, Wilson was at last forced from the position, with
a loss of eight hundred men; while the remainder of his corps
dispersed, and succeeded in reaching Castello Branco.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>At this period a heavy calamity overtook the Spanish arms.
Venegas, after his defeat at Almonacid, had re-organized his
scattered army, and united it with that of Cuesta, who had been
succeeded in the chief command by Ariezaga. That general
absurdly attempted to march at once on Madrid; and at
Toledo encountered a French corps of thirty thousand men, in
readiness to attack him. Although his force nearly doubled
that of the enemy, Ariezaga declined the combat, and endeavoured
to retreat. It was then too late; he was overtaken
by Joseph Buonaparte while crossing the plains of Ocana on
the 19th of November, and totally defeated with a loss of
fifteen thousand men.</p>

<p>In a different scene the Spanish arms were equally unfortunate.
Marchand had succeeded Ney, and he, holding his
enemy in too great contempt, engaged Del Parque under
circumstances which allowed the Duke to obtain a temporary
advantage. The French fell back only to return in greater
force. An action was fought at Tamames, which terminated
at first, in the Spanish being only driven back, but eventually,
in their being utterly derouted.</p>

<p>Following up this success, Soult, with fifty thousand men,
was despatched by Joseph against the southern provinces, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
succeeded in crossing the Sierra Morena, though the whole
range had been strongly fortified, and thirty thousand men
under Ariezaga, intrusted with its defence. So quickly, and
with such trifling loss was this dangerous operation achieved,
that it was a question, whether the marshal was more indebted
for his success to treachery or cowardice. Cadiz was preserved
by the prompt decision of the duke of Albuquerque—the
gates closed against the French—and the city secured against
bombardment, except from one point occupied by Fort Matagorda.</p>

<p>All else had gone favourably for the French. Sebastiani
defeated Ariezaga on his retreat to Grenada—and that city
and Malaga, after a faint effort at defence, fell. Gerona surrendered,
after a brave and protracted resistance.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> Hostalrich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
was also taken;<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> and Astorga capitulated in the middle
of April. In fact, the French were everywhere victorious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
and Spain once more lay nearly at their feet. This, as Colonel
Jones observes, was “the second crisis in the affairs of the
Peninsula, as, by a succession of desultory and ill-planned
enterprises on the part of the Spaniards, all their armies had
been annihilated, their fortresses reduced, and three-fourths of
the kingdom subdued.” Affairs certainly wore a gloomy
aspect. Napoleon had openly announced his determination
to drive the English into the sea; and his means, relieved as
he was by an alliance with Austria, seemed amply sufficient
to realize the threat. Circumstances had increased his
resources, and left him a large disposable force to direct on
Portugal; while Britain, in the madness of her policy, had
wasted her military strength on that ill-designed and disastrous
expedition to the Scheldt.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the British parliament saw—and not too late—the
place where the struggle for European liberty was to be
decided. As many of the Walcheren battalions as could be
made effective, were recruited from the militias and sent out.
The Portuguese, in British pay, were augmented to thirty
thousand men—and England at last, turned her attention to
the point on which her political salvation depended—and
where alone the battle of the Continent should be fought.</p>

<p>Napoleon was, at the same time, pouring in constant reinforcements
over the Pyrenees, and strengthening his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps
d’armée</i> in every province on the Peninsula. The corps of
Ney, Junot, and Reynier, having united at Salamanca, comprised
seventy thousand men, of which six thousand were
cavalry; and Massena arrived from France, by the express
command of Napoleon, to assume the command-in-chief.
A part of the imperial guard crossed the Pyrenees to reinforce
the army of the centre; and another body received orders to
hold itself in readiness to march, and as it was generally
believed, to form a body-guard for the Emperor.</p>

<p>But still, notwithstanding the gloomy prospects of the
British, it was surprising what a number of desertions took
place from the enemy’s corps. Between the commencement
of 1810 and the month of May, nearly five hundred men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
chiefly Germans and Italians, arrived, time after time, at the
British outposts; while desertions from the English regiments
were extremely rare.</p>

<p>Early in May, Massena prepared for active operations, and
invested the fortress of Rodrigo—the inferiority of Lord Wellington’s
force rendering any attempt on his part to prevent
it impossible. All that could be done was to observe the
enemy closely; and for this purpose, head-quarters were
transferred to Almeida—which, after a few days, were farther
retired to Alverca, six leagues in the rear.</p>

<p>The investment of Rodrigo, which occasional advances of
the British had partially relaxed, became now more serious—for
Ney determined that the place should fall—and taking
post on a range of high grounds with thirty thousand men, he
covered effectually the operations carried on by Junot, whose
separate force amounted to forty thousand more.</p>

<p>It was now ascertained that Matagorda<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> had fallen,—that
Cadiz, of course, must yield,—that divisions of the guards had
entered Madrid,—and that Napoleon was absolutely across
the Pyrenees. Other tidings were of better import. Ballasteros
was on the Guadalquiver, and so threatening in his
movements, as to require Reynier to be detached to check
him; while the mountain districts were swarming with
guerillas, who cut off every detached party of the French,
plundered their convoys, interrupted their communications,
and kept the whole of their posts constantly on the alert. In
Castile particularly, their audacity was boundless. They had
carried off an aide-de-camp of Kellerman from the gates of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Valladolid; and no Frenchman could trust himself in the
open country without a powerful escort.</p>

<p>The siege of Rodrigo continued: a gallant resistance was
made, for the garrison disputed every inch of ground, sallying
frequently, and maintaining a well-directed fire that occasioned
the besiegers considerable loss. The old governor, Hervasti,
did wonders—and with a garrison of four thousand men, and
fortifications in bad condition—many parts of the wall having
its breaches only stopped loosely with rubbish—he kept
seventy thousand men at bay, provided with siege stores in
abundance, and a numerous corps of active and scientific
engineers to direct the labours of the thousands who composed
their working parties. On the 30th of June the breach was
practicable, and stormed—but the French were repulsed,
after suffering an enormous loss in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Though the British army looked on, they could not save
the fortress. The siege was pressed, and the outposts of the
two armies came occasionally in contact with each other.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July the French made a strong <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnoissance</i>
with five regiments of cavalry, a corps of infantry, and
some guns. A spirited affair ensued—and Gallegos and
Almeida were given up, and a position taken by the British
in rear of Fort Conception.</p>

<p>Time passed without any affair of moment occurring, until
Ciudad Rodrigo capitulated, after a noble defence<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> of a full
month, with open trenches. Julian Sanchez, finding the
place must fall, quitted the city at midnight with his lancers,
and cut his way through the enemy’s posts.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Ney, it is said, annoyed at the obstinacy with which the
fortress held out, until the breach was found by Hervasti
indefensible, and the troops for the assault were actually
formed in the trenches, declined all terms but unconditional
surrender. Massena, however, with more generosity, conceded
the honours of war to the brave and resolute commandant.</p>

<p>The enemy’s patrols had latterly become exceedingly troublesome,
annoying the villages immediately in front of the
British posts, and plundering them of any thing which could
be found. General Craufurd determined to cut off the next
of these marauding parties, and moved at midnight with six
squadrons of cavalry, in the hope that before daybreak he
should get in the rear of the French patrols, whom he
expected to fall in with. In the darkness he lost his way,
and unexpectedly encountered the enemy in ground where his
cavalry were completely arrested by the French infantry. In
this vexatious affair the British suffered considerable loss,—and
a very valuable officer, Colonel Talbot of the 14th Light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
dragoons, was killed. It was exceedingly mortifying that
two hundred French infantry should escape from six hundred
British dragoons,—and the circumstance occasioned a great
sensation in the coteries of the allied bivouacs.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Consequent on the fall of Rodrigo, numerous movements
took place. It was impossible to guess in what way Massena
would follow up his success, and the best arrangements were
made by Lord Wellington to meet every probable contingency.
One of two plans most likely to be adopted by the
French marshal was either, by reinforcing Reynier, to overpower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
Hill; or, by uniting his (Reynier’s) corps by the pass
of Perales with his own, attack with oppressive numbers the
British on the Coa. The chief danger, however, seemed to
rest in an attack on Hill. If it succeeded, the position of the
Guarda would be untenable, and a precipitous retreat on
Zezere imperative—while on the Coa, there was every thing
in favour of the British. The ground was difficult; three or
four marches would unite Hill’s corps with the main body—and
the Portuguese, it was supposed, would fight bravely in
defence of their own frontier. Every circumstance, therefore,
induced the wish that the French marshal would assail the
British in their position on the Coa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_15">AFFAIR UPON THE COA.—FALL OF ALMEIDA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Action of the Coa.—Almeida besieged.—Great magazine blows up.—Place
surrenders.—Wellington falls back behind the Mondego.—Romana
defeated by Mortier.</p></blockquote>

<p>While the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo was in progress, the
light division, under General Craufurd, after falling back on
the fifth, took up a position on the line of the Azava. From
the contiguity of the enemy, the greatest vigilance was necessary.
The pickets extended from Carpia to the junction of
the Azava and Agueda; and the outpost duty devolved upon
the Germans, with a part of the 16th light dragoons. Craufurd
was particularly directed to avoid a battle—and, in the
event of Soult advancing, he was instructed to give way at
once, and retire across the river. A strict obedience to the
letter of his orders was not among the qualities for which
Craufurd was remarkable; and whether he supposed from his
position being under the guns of Almeida, that it would be
respected by the French, or that he had determined to resist
the forward movement of the enemy, although apprised on
the 21st that the French were advancing, and that Fort Conception
had been abandoned and blown up, he declined passing
the Coa, and formed the light division in line, his left
resting on Almeida, and his right and rear covered by the
river.</p>

<p>At break of day on the 24th, an entire corps, amounting to
eighteen thousand men, of whom three thousand five hundred
were cavalry, with a powerful artillery, attacked the centre
of the position.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> The pickets between Villamula and Almeida
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>were driven back—and retired before overpowering numbers,
skirmishing in beautiful order, and disputing every inch of
ground. An extensive plain stretched from Villamula to the
Coa, intersected by walls and enclosures, and, of course,
afforded a fine field for light infantry manœuvres. Of this
advantage the British availed themselves; and every fence
and hedge were obstinately maintained, until, oppressed by
numbers, they were reluctantly yielded to the enemy.</p>

<p>The centre was now seriously attacked, and though the
95th and Portuguese caçadores fought gallantly, Craufurd
perceived that he could not hold his ground, and determined to
cross the river, beyond which his cavalry and guns had already
retired. A bridge over the Coa was the only route by which
he could retreat—and it lay completely exposed to a sweeping
fire from the French artillery. However, there was no alternative;
the infantry moved off in echelons by its left,—and
though furiously assailed, succeeded in crossing to the other
bank.</p>

<p>The irregularity of the ground, and the frequency and
height of the enclosures, rendered an orderly retreat almost
impracticable; but the operation was boldly and coolly executed.
To prevent the French from forcing the bridge, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
allow time for the regiments to reform, the 43rd and 95th
were drawn up in front of the pass, and directed to oppose to
the last every attempt that the French should make to cross
it.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> The enemy seemed equally determined; and having collected
an imposing force, a fierce and well-sustained attack
produced one of the most desperate and sanguinary encounters
which the annals of modern warfare record.</p>

<p>“The French skirmishers, swarming on the right bank,
opened a biting fire, which was returned as bitterly; the
artillery on both sides played across the ravine, the sounds
were repeated by numberless echoes, and the smoke, rising
slowly, resolved itself into an immense arch, spanning the
whole chasm, and sparkling with the whirling fuzees of the
flying shells. The enemy gathered fast and thickly; his
columns were discovered forming behind the high rocks, and
a dragoon was seen to try the depth of the stream above, but
two shots from the 52nd killed horse and man, and the carcases,
floating between the hostile bands, showed that the river
was impassable. The monotonous tones of a French drum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
were then heard, and in another instant, the head of a noble
column was at the long narrow bridge. A drummer and an
officer, in a splendid uniform, leaped forward together, and
the whole rushed on with loud cries. The depth of the ravine
at first deceived the soldiers’ aim, and two-thirds of the passage
was won ere an English shot had brought down an
enemy; yet a few paces onwards the line of death was traced,
and the whole of the leading French section fell as one man!
Still the gallant column pressed forward, but no foot could
pass that terrible line; the killed and wounded rolled together
until the heap rose nearly even with the parapet, and the
living mass behind melted away rather than give back.</p>

<p>“The shouts of the British now rose loudly, but they were
confidently answered, and, in half an hour, a second column,
more numerous than the first, again crowded the bridge. This
time, however, the range was better judged, and ere half the
distance was won, the multitude was again torn, shattered,
dispersed and slain; ten or twelve men only succeeded in
crossing, and took shelter under the rocks at the brink of the
river.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>Night came—and the light division, after its heroic resistance
against an overwhelming force, retreated, under cover of
the darkness, to a position three leagues from Averca. The
night march was made in perfect order; the artillery brought
safely off; the field equipage removed; and though Massena,
in his despatches, spoke of colours and cannon having been
taken, not a trophy nor a gun was abandoned by Craufurd,
and a loss fully as severe as what he suffered, was inflicted on
the enemy in return. Colonel Hall, who had arrived but the
preceding day from England to join the 43rd, fell in this
affair—and about three hundred and fifty were returned as
killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<p>Never did British troops fight with more gallantry, and at
a greater disadvantage; and if Craufurd—as it must be
admitted by all that he did so—imprudently brought on an
action, no officer, under more trying circumstances, could have
fought himself more ably out of a scrape. That Craufurd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
was, in a military view, to blame, in permitting himself to be
overtaken on the right bank of the river, is true; and to waste
his strength in an unnecessary combat, from which no advantage
could result, was equally injudicious. But no affair
could have been more brilliant than the encounter on the Coa;
and while a useless expenditure of life was to be deplored,
night never fell upon a braver field, or closed more gallant
efforts, than those made by the light regiments of the British
throughout that long and doubtful day.</p>

<p>On the 25th and 26th, the French appeared on the left
bank of the Coa—but it was doubtful whether they would sit
down before Almeida, or merely mask it with a corps, and
push forward at once into Portugal with all their disposable
force. Lord Wellington, in consequence, decided on falling
back to the gorges of the Estrella, where he could command a
strong position, in the event of Massena’s advance forcing on
an engagement. Orders were accordingly issued for the
cavalry to move to Alverca; while the light division marched
to Celerica, the first to Penhancas, the third to Carapentra,
and the fourth continued on the Guarda, to keep the communication
open with Hill’s corps at Alalay.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August, the French regularly sate down
before Almeida, and broke ground on the ensuing day. On
the 26th, at daylight, eleven batteries opened on the fortress,
with a fire from sixty-five pieces of siege artillery. As Almeida
was strongly garrisoned, well provided and stored, and under
the command of an English governor, strong expectations
were entertained that its resistance would far exceed that of
Ciudad Rodrigo, which in every point was the feebler fortress
of the two. But these high hopes were fated to be miserably
disappointed.</p>

<p>On the evening upon which the French batteries had opened,
in transferring ammunition from the grand magazine to the
ramparts, a shell dropped into a tumbril that was leaving the
door of the building, and igniting the powder with which it
was loaded, the tumbril blew up, and most unfortunately communicating
with the depôt, produced a frightful explosion.
The loss of life was, of course, great—numbers both of the
garrison and the inhabitants perished; half the guns were dismounted;
the works shaken to their foundations; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
ammunition reduced to some fifty barrels of powder. Treachery
also was at work; the Portuguese officers in a body, headed
by the second in command, proceeded to the governor<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and
insisted that he should surrender; and the major of artillery,
who had been sent out to propose terms, proved a traitor.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
He acquainted the French marshal with the full extent of the
misfortune occasioned by the explosion; and Massena, perceiving
that Almeida was at his mercy, of course dictated
what terms he pleased.</p>

<p>On entering the ruined fortress, the French general dismissed
the militia to their homes, and having paraded the
troops of the line, tendered them his protection, provided they
joined the invading army, and took service under Napoleon.
“To the eternal disgrace of the persons thus tampered with,
all, both officers and men, embraced the proposal, and all
passed over, without the slightest apparent reluctance, to the
ranks of the enemy.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>When the fall of Almeida was known, Lord Wellington,
who had advanced when Massena broke ground, fell back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
the position on which he had previously retired; and anxious
to get into closer communication with General Hill, he
retreated leisurely on Gouvea. By this movement he checked
any attempt that might have been intended from Sabugal by
Covilhos, and effectually secured the fortified position of
Zezere from being turned.</p>

<p>Yet the situation of the allies was truly critical. The fall
of Almeida permitted Massena to advance with confidence—while
in numbers, the French marshal was immensely superior;<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
and of the allied force, a great portion of the Portuguese
had never been under fire. The news of Romana’s
defeat by Mortier, made matters still more alarming; as the
latter might come up in sufficient time to threaten the right of
the allies by Alcantara or Abrantes.</p>

<p>But Massena’s movements ended this suspense—and
Wellington was about to achieve one of his most splendid
victories.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_16">BUSACO.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">British position.—Movements.—Disposition of the Allies.—Battle of
Busaco.—Casualties of both armies.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was impossible to avoid a battle. Wellington crossed
the Mondego, while the French were concentrated at Viseu.
The first division had been placed in observation of the Oporto
road,—the light, on the road of Viseu; but the French having
passed the Criz, Lord Wellington changed his position, and
fell back upon the heights of Busaco.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>The mountain range, upon which the British retired, was
about eight miles long; its right touching the Mondego, and
the left stretching over very difficult ground to the Sierra de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Caramula. There was a road cresting the Busaco ridge, and
a ford at Pena Cova, communicating with the Murcella ridge—and
the face of the position was steep, rugged and well-defended
by the allied artillery. Along the front a sweeping
fire could be maintained—and on a part of the summit
cavalry might act if necessary.</p>

<p>To an assailing enemy, a position like that of Busaco must
present most serious difficulties; and, therefore, it was generally
believed that Massena would not risk a battle. But
Lord Wellington thought differently; and coolly added, “If
he does, I shall beat him.”</p>

<p>Pack’s division had fallen back on the 22nd; and on the
23rd Massena drove in the British cavalry. The third division
took a position at Antonio de Contara, and the fourth at
the convent; while the light division bivouacked in a pine
wood.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> On the 24th it fell back four miles, and some skirmishing
of no particular importance took place.</p>

<p>The 25th had nearly brought on a second affair between
Craufurd and the enemy. Immense masses of the French
were moving rapidly forward, and the cavalry had interchanged
a pistol fire, when Lord Wellington arrived, and instantly
retired the division. Not a moment could be lost;
the enemy came on with amazing rapidity, but the British rear-guard
behaved with its usual determination; and after a series
of quick and beautifully executed manœuvres, secured their
retreat on the position. Both armies that evening bivouacked
in each other’s presence—and sixty-five thousand French infantry,
covered by a mass of voltigeurs, formed in the British
front; while scarcely fifty thousand of the allies were in line on
the Sierra de Busaco, and these, of necessity, were extended over
a surface which their numbers were quite incompetent to defend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Ney and Reynier agreed that the moment of their arrival
afforded the best chance for attacking Wellington successfully—and
Massena was informed that the allied troops were only
getting into their ground, and that their dispositions were accordingly
imperfect. But the marshal came up too late; for
all the arrangements of Wellington had been coolly and admirably
effectuated.</p>

<p>The British brigades were continuously posted. On the
right, General Hill’s division was stationed. Leith, on his
left, prolonged the line, with the Lusitanian legion in reserve.
Picton joined Leith, and was supported by a brigade of Portuguese.
The brigades of Spencer crested the ridge, and held
the ground between the third division and the convent; and
the fourth division closed the extreme left, covering the mountain
path of Milheada, with part of the cavalry on a flat, and
a regiment of dragoons in reserve on the summit of the Sierra.
Pack’s division formed the advanced guard to the right, and
extended half-way down the hill; while in a hollow below
the convent, the light brigade and Germans were thrown out.
The whole front was covered with skirmishers—and on every
point, from which the artillery could effectively range, the
guns were placed in battery.</p>

<p>While these dispositions were being completed, evening had
come on; both armies establishing themselves for the night,
and the French lighting fires. Some attempts of the enemy
to introduce their tirailleurs, in broken numbers, among the
wooded hollows in front of the light division, indicated an
intention of a night attack, and the rifles and caçadores drove
them back. But no attempt was made—and a mild and warm
atmosphere allowed the troops to bivouac without inconvenience
on the battle-ground. A few hours of comparative
stillness passed—one hundred thousand men slept under the
canopy of heaven; and before the first faint glimmering of
light, all stood quietly to arms, and prepared for a bloody day.</p>

<p>Shrouded by the grey mist that still was lingering on the
Sierra, the enemy advanced. Ney, with three columns, moved
forward in front of the convent, where Craufurd’s division
was posted; while Reynier, with two divisions, approached
by less difficult ground the pickets of the third division, before
the feeble light permitted his movements to be discovered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
With their usual impetuosity the French pushed forward, and
the British as determinately opposed them. Under a heavy
fire of grape and musketry the enemy topped the heights; and
on the left of the third division, gained the summit of the
mountain—their leading battalions securing themselves among
the rocks, and threatening the ridge of the Sierra. The disorder
of a Portuguese regiment, the 8th, afforded them also a partial
advantage. But the fire of two guns with grape opened on
their flank; in front, a heavy fusilade was maintained; while,
advancing over the crown of the height, the 88th and four
companies of the 45th charged furiously with the bayonet,
and with an ardour that could not be resisted. Both French
and English were intermixed in a desperate <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>—both
fought hand to hand—both went struggling down the mountain—the
head of the French column annihilated—and covering
the descent, from the crown to the valley, with heaps of
its dead and dying.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
When a part of the Sierra had been gained, Leith perceiving
that the French had occupied it, moved the 38th on their
right flank, with the Royals in reserve. The 9th formed line
under a heavy fire, and, without returning a shot, fairly deforced
the French grenadiers from the rocks with the
bayonet. The mountain crest was now secure, Reynier completely
repulsed, and Hill, closing up to support, prevented
any attempt being made to recover it.</p>

<p>The greater difficulty of the ground rendered Ney’s attacks
still less successful, even for a time, than Reynier’s had proved.
Craufurd’s disposition of the light division was masterly.
Under a dipping of the ground between the convent and plateau,
the 43rd and 52nd were formed in line; while higher up
the hill, and closer to the convent, the Germans were drawn
up. The rocks in front formed a natural battery for the guns;
and the whole face of the Sierra was crowded with riflemen
and caçadores. Morning had scarcely dawned, when a sharp
and scattered musketry was heard among the broken hollows
of the valley that separated the rival armies—and presently
the French appeared in three divisions—Loisson’s mounting
the face of the Sierra—Marchand’s inclining leftwards, as if it
intended to turn the right flank of the light division—and the
third held in reserve.</p>

<p>The brigade of General Simon led the attack—and reckless
of the constant fusilade of the British light troops, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
sweeping fire of the artillery, which literally ploughed through
the advancing column, from its leading to its last section,
the enemy came steadily and quickly on. The horse-artillery
worked their guns with amazing rapidity—delivering
round after round with such beautiful precision, that
the wonder was, how any body of men could advance
under such a withering and incessant cannonade. But nothing
could surpass the gallantry of the assailants. On they came—and
in a few moments, their skirmishers, “breathless, and
begrimed with powder,” topped the ridge of the Sierra. The
British guns were instantly retired—the French cheers arose—and,
in another second, their column topped the height.</p>

<p>General Craufurd, who had coolly watched the progress of
the advance, called on the 43rd and 52nd to “Charge!” A
cheer that pealed for miles over the Sierra answered the order,
and “eighteen hundred British bayonets went sparkling over
the brow of the hill.” The head of the French column was
overwhelmed in an instant; “both its flanks were lapped over
by the English wings,”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> while volley after volley, at a few
yards’ distance, completed its destruction—and marked with
hundreds of its dead and dying, prostrate on the face of the
Sierra, the course of its murderous discomfiture. Some of the
light troops continued slaughtering the broken columns nearly
to the bottom of the hill, until Ney’s guns opened from the
opposite side, and covered the escape of relics of Simon’s
division.</p>

<p>And yet the bravery of the French merited a better result—no
troops advanced more gallantly; and when the British
steel was glittering in their faces, as with resistless force the
fatal rush was made over the crest of the Sierra, every man of
the first section of the French raised and discharged his
musket,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> although before his finger parted from the trigger,
he knew that an English bayonet would be quivering in his
heart. Simon was wounded and left upon the field, and his
division so totally shattered as to be unable to make any
second attempt.</p>

<p>On the right, Marchand’s brigades having gained the cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of a pine wood, threw out their skirmishers and endeavoured
to surmount the broken surface that the hill everywhere presented.
Pack held them in check—while the Guards, formed
on the brow of the Sierra, were seen in such imposing force,
as to render any attempt on the position useless. Craufurd’s
artillery flanked the pine wood, and maintained a rapid fire;
when, finding his troops sinking under an unprofitable slaughter,
Ney, after the effort of an hour, retired behind the rocks.</p>

<p>The roar of battle was stilled.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Each side removed their
wounded men; and the moment the firing ceased, both parties
amicably intermingled, and sought and brought off their
disabled comrades. When this labour of humanity was over,
a French company having taken possession of a village within
pistol-shot of General Craufurd, stoutly refused to retire when
directed. The commander of the light division turned his
artillery on the post, overwhelmed it in an instant with his
cannonade, and when the guns ceased firing, sent down a few
companies of the 43rd to clear the ruins of any whom his
grape might have left alive,—the obstinacy of the French
officer having drawn upon him, most justly, the anger of the
fiery leader of the light division.</p>

<p>The loss sustained by Massena in his attempt upon the
British position at Busaco was immense.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> A general of
brigade, Graind’orge, and above a thousand men, were killed;
Foy, Merle, and Simon, with four thousand five hundred, were
wounded; and nearly three hundred taken prisoners. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
allied casualties did not exceed twelve hundred and fifty men,
of which nearly one half were Portuguese.</p>

<p>No battle witnessed more gallant efforts on the part of the
enemy than Busaco; and that the British loss should be so
disproportionate to that suffered by the French, can readily
be conceived from the superior fire, particularly of cannon,
which the position of Busaco enabled Lord Wellington to
employ. The Portuguese troops behaved admirably—their
steadiness and bravery were as creditable to the British officers
who disciplined and led them on, as it was satisfactory to the
Commander of the Allies—proving that the Lusitanian levies,
when incorporated with his island soldiery, were an overmatch
for the best troops in Europe.</p>

<h2 id="chap_17">RETREAT TO TORRES VEDRAS.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Massena’s flank movement occasions Wellington to retire from Busaco.—Proclamation
to the Portuguese.—It meets with general obedience.—Beautiful
order of the retreat.—Trant captures the French hospitals at
Coimbra.—Massena’s supposed ignorance of the lines.—Position of
Torres Vedras.</p></blockquote>

<p>Massena had suffered too heavily in his attempt on the British
position, to think of attacking the Sierra de Busaco a
second time. Early on the 28th he commenced quietly
retiring his advanced brigades, and in the evening, was
reported to be marching with all his divisions on the Malhada
road, after having set fire to the woods to conceal his movements,
which was evidently intended to turn the British left.
Orders were instantly given by Lord Wellington to abandon
the Sierra; and at night-fall, Hill’s division was again thrown
across the river—the remainder of the brigades, defiling to
their left, moved by the shorter road on Coimbra, and resumed
the line of the Mondego on the 30th.</p>

<p>The celebrated proclamation to the Portuguese nation was
issued by Lord Wellington previous to the commencement of
his retreat. Determined to destroy any hope the French
might have entertained of subsisting their armies on the
resources of the country, the people were emphatically desired,
on the approach of the enemy, to abandon their dwellings,
drive off their cattle, destroy provisions and forage, and leave
the villages and towns deserted of inhabitants, and devastated
of everything which could be serviceable to the invaders.
Generally, these orders were obeyed with a devotion that
seems remarkable. Property was wasted or concealed<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the shrine and cottage alike abandoned by their occupants—the
peasant deserting the hearth where he had been nursed,
and the monk the altar where he had worshipped from his
boyhood. The fugitives accompanied the army on its march,—and
when it halted in the lines, one portion of the wanderers
proceeded to Lisbon, while the greater number crossed
the Tagus, to seek on its southern shores a temporary retreat
from those who had obliged them to sacrifice their possessions,
and fly from the dwellings of their fathers.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>Nothing could surpass the fine attitude maintained by the
British in their retreat on Torres Vedras, and every march
was leisurely executed, as if no enemy were in the rear. By
the great roads of Leiria and Espinal the receding movement
was effected; and, with the exception of some affairs of
cavalry, and a temporary embarrassment in passing through
Condeixa, occasioned by a false alarm and narrow streets, a
retreat of nearly two hundred miles was effected with as little
confusion as attends an ordinary march. No portion of the
field equipage—no baggage whatever, was captured—and still
more strange, a greater number of prisoners were taken from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
the pursuers than lost by the pursued—a fact, in the history
of retreats, without a parallel.</p>

<p>Whether the severity of the weather by which the roads
were dreadfully cut up, or the privations which his army
experienced in traversing an exhausted country, repressed his
activity, Massena certainly did not press the British with the
vigour that might have been expected from an army so
immensely superior in its numbers, and particularly in cavalry,
an arm so effective in pursuit.</p>

<p>The French had formed an imperfect estimate of the magnificent
position upon which Wellington was retiring. In their
rear, the allies had abundant supplies—while the French
advance led through an exhausted district, an unfriendly
population behind, and a host of irregulars around, waiting an
opportunity to become actively aggressive. In the rear of the
Prince of Esling, Trant, on the Coimbra road, had five thousand
militia—Wilson was at Busaco, in similar strength—while
from the north, Silviera was advancing with fifteen
thousand men, and Bacillar with eight thousand.</p>

<p>The French marshal soon felt the activity of these partisans.
Supposing that Coimbra was safe from aggression, he had left
his hospitals there, as he believed, in perfect security, protected
by a company of marines attached to the Imperial Guard.
Trant, by a sudden and well-executed march, threw himself
between Coimbra and the advancing army, and captured the
entire of the hospitals and stores, with the marines left for their
defence.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>It was said that the French were quite ignorant both of the
position of the lines and the extent of their defences—and that
they were unprepared for finding themselves totally barred
from farther effort by works, embracing eight leagues of
country, and stretching from the Tagus to the ocean. But
that such an undertaking as fortifying Torres Vedras—a
herculean task requiring the labour of thousands to effect, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
an enormous expenditure of money and stores to carry on—that
this could have proceeded to its completion, without its
progress being reported to the invaders, is nothing but a mere
romance, and cannot for a moment be credited.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>Massena, after a three days’ <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i>, and under the
advice of his chief engineers, abandoned all hope of forcing
this singular position—and when Torres Vedras is described,
it will be admitted that the marshal’s decision was correct.</p>

<p>These celebrated lines, constructed to protect an embarkation
should it be necessary, and cover the capital from attack,
were planned by Lord Wellington, and executed chiefly by
Colonel Fletcher and Captain Jones of the engineers—and to
describe them, the features of the country over which they
extended must be briefly noticed.</p>

<p>The Peninsula on which Lisbon stands, is traversed by two
lofty heights, which stretch from the Tagus to the ocean,
varying in altitude and abruptness, and running in a parallel
direction, at a distance of from six to nine miles. Through
the passes in these mountains, the four great roads that communicate
between Lisbon and the interior run. The line on
the Sierra next the capital is the stronger of the two. It
commences at Ribumar, on the Rio Lorenzo, runs by Mafra,
Cabeca de Montachique, and the pass of Bucellas, and descends
precipitously on the plain, about an English league from the
Tagus. This latter is the only weak point—and every means
that skill and labour could effect, was exhausted to fortify
every spot that Nature had left open, and thus render Torres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Vedras—its extent considered—the strongest position in
Europe.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>“In front of Via Longa, upon an eminence rising from the
plain, at a short distance from the river, six redoubts were
constructed, so situated, in consequence of the nearly circular
formation of the plateau, as to command the approaches in every
direction within the range of their artillery. Three of these
immediately domineered the great route from Alhandra to Lisbon,
to the right of which, upon a knoll, in front of the town
of Povoa, another work was formed, sweeping the communication
in the direction of Quintella. On the bank of the Tagus,
a redoubt, armed with four twelve-pounders, terminated the
line at its eastern extremity. Fifty-nine redoubts, containing
two hundred and thirty-two pieces of cannon, estimated to
require seventeen thousand five hundred men to garrison them,
protected the weaker points, enfiladed the roads, or swept the
ascent to the escarped mountains in the range of this extended
position, occupying a front of twenty-two miles.”</p>

<p>“The front line had been originally intended for one of
isolated posts, rather than an unbroken extent of defensive
ground, which it was subsequently made. It rests also on the
Atlantic at the mouth of the Lozandra; its weakest point being
in the rear of the village of Runa, where it stretches to Monte
Agraça, and ample care was taken to correct this natural
defect.”</p>

<p>“On the Sierra, in the rear of Sobral, was constructed a
redoubt of great magnitude, armed with twenty-five pieces of
artillery, and prepared for a garrison of one thousand men.
This formidable work, from its commanding and centrical
situation, was the constant daily resort of Lord Wellington.
There he came every morning, and continued until it was
ascertained that no hostile movement had taken place, and
until light permitted a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i> of the enemy’s troops
encamped opposite. From the redoubt on Monte Agraça, the
line continued, crossing the valleys of Arruda and Calhandriz,
until it rested on the Tagus at Alhandra.”</p>

<p>“Nature and art had rendered the ground from Calhandriz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
to the river particularly strong; but to make the defences
still more formidable, and to form an intermediate obstruction,
redoubts were thrown up extending to the rear, nearly at
right angles with the front line. These swept the whole portion
of the valley, by which a column of infantry must penetrate,
even had it succeeded in forcing an entrance into the
ravine. Sixty-nine works of different descriptions fortified
this line; in these were mounted three hundred and nineteen
pieces of artillery, requiring upwards of eighteen thousand men
to garrison them; and the extent, in a direct line from flank
to flank, was twenty-five miles.”</p>

<p>Colonel Leith Hay explains the mode in which those formidable
lines would have been defended. “It has been erroneously
supposed that the regular army was, in the event of an
attack, to occupy the redoubts and other works in the lines,
or, at all events, that a large proportion of the troops would of
necessity defend these temporary fortifications. In this calculation
of probable circumstances, no British soldiers, with the
exception of artillery, would have acted within their walls.
Some Portuguese infantry, with the militia and ordonanza,
were destined to compose the garrisons; while the whole allied
army, numerous, brilliant in equipment, high in spirit, confident
in its great commander, was prepared to move in every direction
to cover the summits of mountains, to descend into valleys,
or to pour in torrents on any luckless column, that with diminished
numbers might have forced past the almost impenetrable
obstacles of this grand position.”</p>

<p>“In addition to the works thrown up in either line, or in
the intervening points of communication, rivers were obstructed
in their course, flooding the valleys and rendering the country
swampy and impassable; trenches were cut from whence
infantry, perfectly protected, might fire on the advancing
columns of an enemy; these being also flanked by artillery,
sweeping the approaches to them in every direction. Mountains
were scarped as above stated; abattis of the most formidable
description, either closed the entrance to ravines, impeded
an approach to the works, or blocked up roads, in which deep
cuts were also marked out for excavation; routes conducting
from the front were rendered impracticable; others within
the lines either repaired, or formed to facilitate communication,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
to admit the passage of artillery, or reduce the distance by
which the troops had to move for the purposes of concentration
or resistance; bridges were mined, and prepared for explosion.
Telegraphs erected at Alhandra, Monte Agraça,
Socorra, Torres Vedras, and in the rear of Ponte de Rol,
rapidly communicated information from one extremity of the
line to the other. These signal stations were in charge of
seamen from the fleet in the Tagus. To complete the barriers,
palisades, platforms, and planked bridges, leading into the
works, fifty thousand trees were placed at the disposal of the
engineer department, during the three months ending on the
7th of October, 1810.”</p>

<p>“The cannon in the works were supplied by the Portuguese
government. Cars, drawn by oxen, transported twelve-pounders
where wheels had never previously rolled. Above three
thousand officers and artillerymen of the country assisted in
arming the redoubts, and were variously employed in the lines.
At one period, exclusive of these, of the British engineers,
artificers, or infantry soldiers, seven thousand peasantry
worked as labourers in the completion of an undertaking only
to have been accomplished under the most favourable circumstances,
both with regard to cordiality of assistance, neighbouring
arsenals, a British fleet in the Tagus, constant uninterrupted
communication with a great capital, a regular remuneration
to the labourers, an anxious and deep interest in the
result to be accomplished by the assistance of the works in
progress, and, above all, an intelligence and firmness in command
that could at the same time extract the greatest benefits
from these combinations, and urge exertion where it appeared
to relax.”</p>

<p>Such was the matchless position to which Wellington
retired—and the allied army thus occupied the several posts.
Monte Agraça was held by Pack, and a Portuguese brigade.
The fifth division encamped on the reverse of the heights,
behind the grand redoubt. Hill occupied Alhandra. The
light division was posted at Arriada. The first, fourth, and
sixth, were at Zibriera, Ribaldiera, and Runa; their right in
contact with Leith; their left with Picton—who, with the
third division, occupied Torres Vedras, and defended the
Zezandra.</p>

<h2 id="chap_18">RETREAT OF MASSENA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Massena retires from before the lines.—Falls back upon the frontier.—Operations
during the French retreat.—Massena driven from Portugal.—Outrages
committed by the French.—British head-quarters established
at Villa Formosa.</p></blockquote>

<p>After a three days’ <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i>, nothing could surpass
the chagrin and surprise that Junot exhibited to his staff,
when, by personal observation, he had ascertained the full
extent of the defences, with which British skill had perfected
what nature had already done so much for. To attempt
forcing Torres Vedras, must have ensured destruction; and
nothing remained, but to take a position in its front, and
observe that immense chain of posts, which it was found
impossible to carry.</p>

<p>During the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i> of the French marshal, an
advanced redoubt, held by the 71st, had been furiously
assaulted. But the attempt terminated in a severe repulse;—and
in place of carrying the post, the French were driven
from a field-work, thrown up upon ground which they called
their own. Nor were Massena’s surveys of the lines accomplished
without attracting observation. The movement of a
numerous staff excited the attention of the allies; and, on one
occasion, when approaching closer than prudence would warrant,
a round shot fell so near the marshal’s horse, that the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i> was terminated most abruptly, and the lines, for
the future, were respected.</p>

<p>The Prince of Esling persevered, while any resources could
be procured, in remaining before Torres Vedras. But though
by cavalry patrols on the right bank of the Tagus and the
detachment of a division to Thomar, he had enlarged the
scope of country over which his foragers could operate, supplies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
failed fast; and even French ingenuity<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> failed in discovering
concealed magazines. Nothing remained but to retire
from cantonments where provisions were no longer procurable—on
the morning of the 15th, the French army broke up—and,
favoured by thick weather, retired in beautiful order on
Santarem and Torres Novas.</p>

<p>Wellington, on discovering the regressive movement of
Massena, promptly despatched a division on either route, and
speedily put his whole army in pursuit, leaving the lines
secured by a sufficient force. He marched on the routes of the
Mondega and the Zezere, it being uncertain by which of these
roads the French should retreat from Portugal. The Zezere,
however, was supposed to be the line. Hill was pushed over
the Tagus, to march on Abrantes; and Lord Wellington,
believing that Santarem was occupied only by a rear-guard,
notwithstanding the nature of the ground rendered an attack
difficult and hazardous, resolved to force it without delay.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>Every disposition was made; but fortunately the allied
commander having remarked appearances, which induced him
to suspect that recent field-works had been thrown up, on a
closer examination detected such powerful means of defence,
as occasioned him to countermand the order for advancing.
Both armies went into cantonments; the allies with head-quarters
at Cartaxo,—the French having chosen Torres Novas
for theirs.</p>

<p>Little of military interest occurred for some time, excepting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
that the Portuguese militias, under their English
officers, were incessant in harassing the French. Grant, with
the corps he commanded, obliged Gardanne to fall back with
the loss of his baggage, while attempting to protect a convoy
of stores and ammunition to the French posts on the Zezere.
But this was counterbalanced by a reverse of fortune. Too
much excited by success, a part of the Portuguese ordonanza<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
attacked Claparede at Trarnosa. The result was what might
have been expected from a collision with regular troops; they
were severely checked, and driven with considerable loss
across the Douro.</p>

<p>Time passed on,—nothing of moment occurred,—the
British remaining quiet, in expectation of a reinforcement of
troops from England. A strong <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i>, however, was
made by the French at Rio Mayor, under the command of
Junot, who was wounded on the occasion. A period of
inaction succeeded—and each army rested in the other’s
presence.</p>

<p>The first movements that took place were an advance on
Punhete by the allies, and the sudden retirement from Santarem
by the French. Massena chose the left bank of the
Mondego as his line of retreat, falling back on Guarda and
Almeida. Wellington followed promptly; and on the 9th,
Massena having halted in front of Pombal, the allies hastened
forward to attack him. But the French Marshal declined an
action, and fell back pressed closely by the British light troops,
and covered by a splendid rear-guard which he had formed
from his choicest battalions, and intrusted to the command of
Marshal Ney.</p>

<p>At Redinha, the French made a daring stand; and though
the heights on the left and right were simultaneously carried,
Ney resolutely held his ground, until masses of British infantry
coming up, obliged him to retire. This he effected by the
ford and bridge of Redinha, masking his retreat by the fire of
his musketry. By this daring halt he secured a start of
many hours for the sick and wounded, who were moving
on Condeixa with the baggage and field equipage of the
army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Massena continued retiring by Ponte Murcella, while
Clausel moved by Ponte Cobreta, and kept his communications
open with Loison, and the eighth corps.</p>

<p>Here, Massena had nearly been surprised. Believing himself
perfectly secure, he was arranging a leisurely retreat,
when the third division, which had passed the mountain by a
difficult path, suddenly appeared in the rear of his left. An
instant movement was necessary to save himself from being
cut off from the road to Casa Nova; for the rapid advance of
the British light troops had nearly succeeded in making Massena
himself a prisoner.</p>

<p>The pursuit was actively continued,—in the eagerness of
advancing, the light division had been imprudently pushed
forward—and in the haze of the morning, the 52nd came unexpectedly
in front of an entire corps. Of course, they were
briskly attacked; and their being engaged, brought on a
general affair, in which the whole light division took part, and
thus prevented a flank movement by the third and fourth
divisions from being effected, that promised a successful result.
Ney retired in beautiful order by echelons of divisions, contesting
every bridge and pass; and, under a constant fire of
horse artillery, and the unremitting pursuit of light troops, he
retreated safely on Miranda de Corvo, and united himself
with the main body and cavalry of Montbrun.</p>

<p>Massena continued his retreat by the line of road between
the Mondego and the mountains, while Ney again took a
position at Fonte d’Aronce. There Lord Wellington attacked
him vigorously. The third division, with their usual impetuosity,
forced the French left, and the horse artillery completed
their disorder. They passed the Ceira in great confusion,—many
being trampled down upon the bridge, and more
drowned in attempting to cross the river where the water was
not fordable. The casualties on the part of the allies were
trifling, but the French loss was estimated at five hundred
men.</p>

<p>Ney, having blown up the bridge, necessarily delayed the
British advance, while the engineers were throwing another
over the Ceira. Immediately, Wellington passed his army
over, and Massena had to fall back, and take up a position on
the Sierra de Moìta. From this, however, he was quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
driven, and obliged to abandon any stores and baggage that
were difficult of transport: while a number of his stragglers
fell into the hands of the allies and Portuguese irregulars,
which latter incessantly annoyed him by hanging on his route,
and threatening his flanks and rear.</p>

<p>Having gained the position of the Guarda, Massena appeared
determined to make a stand; but his opponent was
equally resolved to expel him from the Portuguese territory,
and preparations were made to effect it at daybreak.</p>

<p>The morning was extremely foggy—Beckwith’s brigade of
the light division prematurely crossed the river, and the rifles,
in extended order, and the 43rd in column, mounted the
heights. The French pickets were driven in—but when the
haze suddenly dispersed, the British light troops found themselves
immediately in front of Regnier’s entire corps. Colonel
Beckwith charged and won the height; but here he was furiously
assailed,—and on front and flank, attacked by overwhelming
numbers, while the fire of two guns at musket distance,
poured in a deadly discharge of grape-shot. Fortunately,
a stone enclosure enabled him to obtain a temporary
shelter from his assailants,—and the 43rd opened and sustained,
from behind the low wall that covered them, a quick
and murderous fire.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> The remainder of the light division
came on boldly to the relief of their comrades—and again
Beckwith resumed the offensive, and, charging from the
inclosure, captured a howitzer that had been advanced by the
French to the brow of the hill. The fifth division had carried
the bridge of Sabugal, and the third having gained ground on
Regnier’s right flank, obliged him to retire rapidly on Alfayates,
leaving the battle-field in possession of the allies.</p>

<p>Had not the action of the Coa sufficiently established the
character of the light division, that of Sabugal would have
conferred on it a proud and well-deserved distinction. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
Wellington described it as “one of the most glorious actions
that British troops were ever engaged in,”—and nothing could
surpass the extraordinary daring with which a force, so immensely
inferior, not only held its position when for a time
isolated and unsupported, but afterwards, becoming assailants,
captured and secured the trophy of their victory.</p>

<p>On the 5th of April, Massena crossed the frontier. Portugal
was now without the presence of a Frenchman, except the
garrison of Almeida, and those who had been taken prisoners
in the numerous affairs between the British light troops and
the enemy’s rear-guard. Nothing could be bolder or more
scientific than the whole course of Wellington’s operations,
from the time he left the lines, until Massena “changed his
position from the Zezere to the Agueda.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Yet, it must be
admitted, that the French retreat all through was conducted
with consummate ability. Ney commanded the rear-guard
with excellent judgment; his positions were admirably
selected; and when assailed, they were defended as might have
been expected from one who had already obtained the highest
professional reputation.</p>

<p>In a military view, Massena’s retreat was admirable, and
reflected infinite credit on the generals who directed it; but, in
a moral one, nothing could be more disgraceful. The country
over which the retreating columns of the French army passed,
was marked by bloodshed and devastation. Villages were
every where destroyed,—property wasted or carried off,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
men shot in sheer wantonness,—the women villanously abused,—while
thousands were driven for shelter to the mountains,
where many perished from actual want. With gothic barbarity,
the fine old city of Leria, and the church and convent
of Alcabaca, with its library and relics, were ordered by Massena
to be burned. The order was too faithfully executed;
and places, for centuries objects of Portuguese veneration,
were given to the flames; and those hallowed roofs, beneath
which “the sage had studied and the saint had prayed,” were
reduced to ashes, to gratify a ruthless and vindictive spirit of
revenge.</p>

<p>Almeida was closely blockaded, and the head-quarters of
the allies established at Villa Formosa,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> while their brigades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
were cantoned generally in advance. Finding himself enabled
to quit the army for a time, Lord Wellington set out for the
Alemtejo, to confer with Marshal Beresford, and inspect the
detached divisions.</p>

<h2 id="chap_19">FALL OF BADAJOZ—TO THE BATTLE
OF BAROSA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Badajoz invested.—Death of Menacho.—Fall of the city.—French movements.—Affair
at Campo Mayor.—Position of Beresford.—Expedition
under Graham.—Battle of Barosa.</p></blockquote>

<p>Badajoz had received an addition to its garrison from some
Spanish troops who had escaped the slaughter at Gevora.
The fortress was in excellent condition for defence, plentifully
supplied with ammunition, and with abundant provisions for
its defenders. All, of course, was in favour of its holding
out; and Raphael Menacho, an officer of distinguished gallantry,
had been appointed governor.</p>

<p>The French broke ground without loss of time, and sate
down before the place; while the garrison exhibited the best
spirit, and by their bold and frequent sallies, occasioned the
greatest annoyance to the besiegers. Menacho retrenched the
streets, and made necessary preparations for a stubborn
defence, which equally evinced his ability as an officer and
determination as a man.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of March, the French having pushed their
approaches to the covered-way, to enable them to blow down
the counterscarp,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> the Spanish governor determined on a
sally. It was bravely executed, and Menacho, in person, led
the sortie. The batteries near the counterscarp were destroyed,
the guns spiked, and the works ruined. But, alas!
this success was dearly purchased, for the brave veteran was
killed in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>.</p>

<p>His successor, a dastardly and treacherous villain, obeyed
the first summons—and having secured liberty for himself, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
once surrendered the fortress. To mark probably, their own
sense of the dishonour this base act of cowardice had entailed
upon the garrison, the Spanish workmen were obliged by the
French to enlarge the breach, in order to admit the grenadiers
to pass through it.</p>

<p>Soult, after the fall of Badajoz, returned to Seville; Mortier
marched upon Campo Mayor; and Latour Maubourg occupied
Albuquerque and Alcantara with the cavalry. Though but a
weak place, and mounted with a few guns, Campo Mayor was
bravely defended by a Portuguese officer named Tallia—and
only surrendered to the French when a longer resistance was
neither prudent nor practicable.</p>

<p>Beresford had received directions from Lord Wellington to
reduce Badajoz, and relieve Campo Mayor. On the 26th, his
advanced guard, consisting of a strong corps of infantry and
two thousand British and Portuguese dragoons, appeared
before Campo Mayor as the French were in the very act of
retiring from the place, and removing their siege artillery
under the protection of a large body of cavalry and field guns.
Colborne marched with the infantry on the right—Head, with
the 13th light dragoons, and two squadrons of Portuguese, on
the left—and the heavy cavalry formed a reserve. Perceiving
that their battering train was endangered, the French cavalry,
as the ground over which they were retiring was favourable
for the movement, charged the 13th. But they were vigorously
repulsed; and, failing in breaking the British, the whole,
consisting of four regiments, drew up in front, forming an
imposing line. The 13th instantly formed and galloped
forward—and nothing could have been more splendid than
their charge. They rode fairly through the French,—overtook
and cut down many of the gunners, and at last entirely
headed the line of march, keeping up a fierce and straggling
encounter with the broken horsemen of the enemy, until some
of the English dragoons actually reached the gates of Badajoz,
where a few of them were captured.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
It was a subject of regret that this dashing exploit of the
light cavalry did not receive the support it merited. Had the
heavy dragoons been vigorously pushed forward, the detachment
and their guns must have been necessarily cut off. In
the affair, the French lost nearly three hundred men, including
a colonel of dragoons—and a howitzer was secured by the
British.</p>

<p>Marshal Beresford continued his operations, and made
preparations for the investment of Badajoz; Olivenza was
reduced; the French nearly expelled from Estremadura; and
in a cavalry affair at Santos Maimona, the enemy were charged
and broken, with a considerable loss in killed and wounded,
and nearly one hundred prisoners.</p>

<p>On the 21st, Lord Wellington arrived—and on the 22nd
he passed the Caya with a strong corps of German and Portuguese
cavalry, and made a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i> of Badajoz. The
governor showed him his garrison,—for, to save a convoy that
was approaching, he marched all his disposable troops from
the town.</p>

<p>To Marshal Beresford a trust of serious responsibility was
confided. He had Badajoz to occupy him on one hand, with
every reason to expect that Soult would advance, and raise
the siege if possible—and under these circumstances, a battle
might be anticipated. The marshal was also authorized by
Lord Wellington, in the event of his being able to engage the
French on fair terms, to accept battle at Albuera.</p>

<p>Another action, by a British general of division, occurred,
arising from the attempt of an Anglo-Spanish army to raise
the siege of Cadiz. All bade fair for success, as the French
had scarcely ten thousand men in their lines, while in the city
and Isle de Leon, the Spanish force was more than twenty
thousand. On this occasion, Graham acted under the command
of La Pena,—and eleven thousand allied troops were
despatched from Cadiz to Tarifa, to operate against the
enemy’s rear at Chiclana; while it was arranged that Zayas,
who commanded in the Isle de Leon, should pass his troops
over San Petri near the sea, and unite in a combined attack.</p>

<p>After much delay, occasioned by tempestuous weather, the
troops and artillery were safely assembled at Tarifa on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
27th; and when joined by the 28th regiment and the flank
companies of the 9th and 82nd, they numbered about four
thousand five hundred effective men.</p>

<p>General La Pena arrived the same day with seven thousand
Spaniards; and on the next, the united force moved through
the passes of the Ronda hills, and halted within four leagues
of the French outposts. The commands of the allies were
thus distributed,—the vanguard to Lardizable, the centre to
the Prince of Anglona, the reserve to General Graham, and
the cavalry to Colonel Whittingham. Victor, though apprized
of the activity of the Spaniards, and the march of
General Graham, could not correctly ascertain the point upon
which their intended operations would be directed; and
therefore, with eleven thousand choice troops, he took post in
observation between the roads of Conil and Medina.</p>

<p>On the 2nd, the capture of Casa Viejas, increased La
Pena’s force by sixteen hundred infantry, and a number of
guerilla horse. Until the 5th, he continued his movements—and,
after his advanced guard had been roughly handled by a
squadron of French dragoons, he halted on the Cerro de
Puerco—more generally and gloriously known as the heights
of Barosa.</p>

<p>Barosa, though not a high hill, rises considerably above the
rugged plain it overlooks, and stands four miles inland from
the débouchement of the Santi Petri. The plain is bounded on
the right by the forest of Chiclana, on the left by cliffs on the
sea-beach, and on the centre by a pine wood, beyond which
the hill of Bermeja rises.</p>

<p>The irregularity and tardiness of the Spanish movements
gave a portentous warning of what might be expected from
them in the field. They occupied fifteen hours in executing
a moderate march, passing over the ground in a rambling and
disorderly manner, that seemed rather like peasants wandering
from a fair, than troops moving in the presence of an
enemy. La Pena, without waiting to correct his broken
ranks, sent on a vanguard to Zayas; while his rear, entirely
separated from the centre, was still straggling over the
country,—and contrary to the expressed wishes of Graham,
who implored him to hold Barosa, he declined his advice, and
ordered the British to march through the pine wood on Bermeja.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
Graham, supposing that Anglona’s division and the
cavalry would continue to occupy the hill, leaving the flank
companies of the 9th and 82nd to protect his baggage, obeyed
the order, and commenced his march. But the astonishment
of the English general was unbounded, when, on entering the
wood, he saw La Pena moving his entire corps from the
heights of Barosa, with the exception of three or four battalions
and as many pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the English General was not the only person
who had observed that Barosa was abandoned. Victor,
concealed in the forest of Chiclana, anxiously watched the
movements of the allies. He saw the fatal error committed
by the Spanish leader—and instantly made dispositions to
profit from the ignorance and obstinacy of his antagonist.</p>

<p>The French Marshal, having selected three grenadier battalions
as reserves, strengthened his left wing with two, and
three squadrons of cavalry, while the other was attached to
his centre. Ruffin commanded the left, Laval the centre;
while Villatte, with two thousand five hundred infantry,
covered the camp, and watched the Spaniards at Santa Petri
and Bermeja. The cavalry, stationed at Medina and Arcos,
were ordered by Victor to move on Vejer and cut off the allies—for
on their certain defeat the French General entertained
no doubt.</p>

<p>The time was admirably chosen for a decisive movement.
The British corps were defiling through the wood—the
strength of the Spaniards posted on the Bermeja—another
division pursued a straggling march on Vejer—and a
fourth, in great confusion, was at Barosa, as a protection to
the baggage. Making Villatte’s division a pivot, Victor
pushed Laval at once against the British,—and ascending the
back of the hill with Ruffin’s brigade, he threw himself
between the Spaniards and Medina, dispersed the camp followers
in an instant, and captured the guns and baggage.</p>

<p>Graham, when apprised of this sudden and unexpected movement,
countermarched directly on the plain, to co-operate, as
he believed, with La Pena, whom he calculated on finding on
the heights—but never was reliance placed by a brave soldier
on a more worthless ally. The Spaniard had deceived him—himself
was gone—his mob-soldiery were fugitives—Ruffin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
on the heights—the French cavalry between him and the sea—and
Laval close on the left flank of the British.</p>

<p>It was indeed a most perilous situation—and in that extremity,
the brave old man to whom the British had been fortunately
confided, proved himself worthy of the trust. He
saw the ruin of retreat,—safety lay in daring—and though
the enemy held the key of the position with fresh troops,
Graham boldly determined to attack them with his wearied
ones.</p>

<p>The battle was instantly commenced. Duncan’s artillery
opened a furious cannonade on the column of Laval; and
Colonel Barnard, with the rifles and Portuguese Caçadores,
extended to the left and began firing. The rest of the British
troops formed two masses, without regard to regiments or
brigades; one, under General Dilkes, marched direct against
Ruffin,—and the other under Colonel Whately, boldly attacked
Laval. On both sides the guns poured a torrent of grape and
canister over the field; the infantry kept up a withering fire;
and both sides advanced, for both seemed anxious to bring
the contest to an issue. Whately, when the lines approached,
came forward to the charge—he drove the first line on the
second, and routed both with slaughter.</p>

<p>Brown had marched at once on Ruffin, and though half his
small number had been annihilated by an overwhelming fire,
he held his ground till Dilkes came to his assistance. Never
pausing to correct their formation, which the rugged hill had
considerably disorganized, on came the British desperately—they
were still struggling to attain the summit—and approaching
the ridge, breathless and disordered, their opponents advanced
to meet them. A furious combat, hand to hand ensued—for
a moment victory seemed doubtful—but the British fought
with a ferocity that nothing could oppose. Whole sections
went down, but still the others pressed forward. Ruffin and
Rousseau, who commanded the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of the grenadiers, fell
mortally wounded. The British never paused—on they went,
delivering volley after volley—forcing the French over the
heights, and defeating them with the loss of their guns.</p>

<p>The divisions of Victor, though dreadfully cut up, fell back
on each other for mutual support, and endeavoured to rally—but
Duncan’s guns were moved forward, and opened a close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
and murderous fire that prevented a possibility of reforming.
Nothing could save the shattered battalions from that exterminating
cannonade but an instant retreat—and Victor
retired, leaving the British in undisputed possession of the
field, from which want of food and continued fatigue, while
under arms for four-and-twenty hours, of course prevented
them from moving in pursuit.</p>

<p>Never was there a shorter, and never a bloodier conflict.
Though it lasted scarcely an hour and a quarter, out of the
handful of British troops engaged, a loss was sustained of
fifty officers, sixty sergeants, and eleven hundred rank and
file. The French, besides two thousand killed and wounded,
lost six guns, an eagle, and two generals, with nearly five
hundred prisoners.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the dastardly duplicity with which
the Spanish general abandoned his gallant ally. La Pena
never made a movement towards the succour of the British—and
although the French cavalry scarcely exceeded two hundred
men, and the Spanish, under Whittingham, amounted to
more than six, the latter never drew a sabre. Never was
there a finer field for cavalry to act upon with effect—Ruffin’s
left was perfectly open—and even a demonstration of attack
must have turned defeat to ruin. Three troops of German
hussars, under Ponsonby, reached the field at the close of the
battle, just as the beaten divisions were attempting to unite.
They charged through the French squadrons, overthrew them,
captured two guns, and sabred many of Ruffin’s grenadiers,
while endeavouring to regain their ranks.</p>

<p>To paint the character of Barosa in a few words, Napier’s
will best describe it. “The contemptible feebleness of La
Pena furnished a surprising contrast to the heroic vigour of
Graham,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> whose attack was an inspiration rather than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
resolution—so wise, so sudden was the decision, so swift, so
conclusive was the execution.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_20">BATTLE OF FUENTES D’ONORO.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Massena takes the field.—Attempts to relieve Almeida.—Lord Wellington
prevents it.—Battle of Fuentes d’Onoro.</p></blockquote>

<p>The army of Portugal, reinforced by that of the north, and
two divisions of the ninth corps, mustering forty thousand
infantry, and nearly four thousand horse, quitted their cantonments;
while Wellington, apprised of this concentration, hastened
from the south to Formosa, and resumed the command
of the allies, whose force might be computed at thirty-two
thousand infantry, and one thousand five hundred cavalry.</p>

<p>Massena’s great object in taking the field again, was to raise
the blockade of Almeida, then closely invested by Lord Wellington;
while the English commander, determined that this
important fortress should not be relieved, resolved, even on
unfavourable ground and with an inferior force, to risk a
battle.</p>

<p>The river Coa flows past Almeida—its banks are dangerous
and steep, and its points of passage few. Beside the bridge
of the city, there is a second, seven miles up the stream, at
Castello Bom; and a third, twenty miles farther still, at
Sabugal. To fight with the river in his rear was hazardous;
but Wellington had decided on his course of action, and accordingly
he selected the best position which a country of no great
military strength would afford.</p>

<p>The Duas Casas runs in a northerly course and nearly
parallel with the Coa, having on its left bank the village of
Fuentes d’Onoro. It is a sweet hamlet, and prettily situated
in front of a sloping hill of easy access, here and there intersprinkled
with woods of cork and ilex. The village was a
feature of considerable military importance, the channel of the
Duas Casas being rocky and broken, and its banks generally
steep. Fuentes was occupied by the light troops—the third
division were posted on a ridge crossing the road to Villa
Formosa—the brigades of Craufurd and Campbell had formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
behind the village of Alameda, to observe the bridge over the
Duas Casas—Pack’s division observed Almeida closely, and
shut in the garrison—Erskine held the great road that crosses
the Duas Casas by a ford—while the guerilla cavalry were
placed in observation, two miles on the right, at the village of
Nava-de-Aver. The position was very extensive, covering,
from flank to flank, a surface of nearly six miles.</p>

<p>The military attitude which the allied commander held,
compared with that of the preceding year, was singularly
changed. Then, his being able to maintain himself in the
country was more than questionable; now, and in the face of
those corps who had driven him on Torres Vedras, he stood
with a divided force—and while two sieges were being carried
on, he protected the great roads, by which the divisions who
conducted them were secured; and, as results best proved,
attempted nothing beyond what he had means and talents
to effect.</p>

<p>On the 1st and 2nd of May, Massena, with an immense
convoy, passed the rivers Agueda and Azava, with the intention
of relieving Almeida, and providing it with every means
for insuring a protracted defence. On the 3rd, in the evening,
the French sixth corps appeared on the heights above Fuentes
d’Onoro, and commenced a lively cannonade, followed up by a
furious assault upon the village. The light companies, who
held Fuentes, sustained the attack bravely, until they were
supported by the 71st, and, as the affair grew warmer, by the
79th and 24th. Colonel Williams was wounded—and the
command devolving on Colonel Cameron, he remedied a temporary
disorder that had been occasioned by the fall of several
officers, and again restored the battle. The ground for a time
gained by the French was inch by inch recovered; and, probably,
during the Peninsular conflicts, a closer combat was
never maintained, as, in the main street particularly, the rival
troops fought fairly hand to hand.</p>

<p>The French were finally expelled from the village. Night
was closing; undismayed by a heavy loss, and unwearied by a
hardly-contested action, a cannon—as it appeared to be—being
seen on the adjacent heights, the 71st dashed across the
rivulet, and bearing down all resistance, reached and won the
object of their enterprise. On reaching it, however, the Highlanders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
discovered that in the haze of evening they had mistaken
a tumbrel for a gun—but they bore it off, a trophy of
their gallantry.</p>

<p>The British regiments held the village. The next day
passed quietly over, while Massena carefully reconnoitred the
position of his opponent. It was suspected that he intended
to change his plan of attack, and manœuvre on the right;
and to secure that flank, Houston’s division was moved to
Posa Velha, the ground there being weak, and the river fordable.
As had been anticipated, favoured by the darkness,
Massena “marched his troops bodily to the left,”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> placing his
whole cavalry, with Junot’s corps, right in front of Houston’s
division. A correspondent movement was consequently made;
Spencer’s and Picton’s divisions moved to the right, and Craufurd,
with the cavalry, marched to support Houston.</p>

<p>At daybreak the attack was made. Junot carried the village
of Posa Velha, and the French cavalry drove in that of
the allies. But the infantry, supported by the horse artillery,
repulsed the enemy and drove them back with loss.</p>

<p>A difficult and a daring change of position was now required,
and Lord Wellington, abandoning his communication with the
bridge at Sabugal, retired his right, and formed line at right
angles with his first formation, extending from the Duas Casas,
towards Frenada on the Coa.</p>

<p>This necessary operation obliged the seventh and light divisions,
in the face of a bold and powerful cavalry, to retire
nearly two miles; and it required all the steadiness and rapidity
of British light infantry to effect the movement safely.
Few as the British cavalry were, they charged the enemy frequently,
and always with success; while the horse artillery
sustained their well-earned reputation, acting with a boldness
that at times almost exposed them to certain capture. Ramsay’s
troop was at one time actually cut off—but by the
bravery of the men and the superior quality of his horses, he
galloped through the surrounding hussars, and carried off his
battery.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> The infantry, in squares of battalions, repelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
every charge; while the Chasseurs Brittanique kept up a
flanking fire, that, while the retrogression of the British was
being effected, entailed a considerable loss on the assailants
who were pressing them closely.</p>

<p>The new position of the British was most formidable. The
right appuied upon a hill, topped by an ancient tower, and
the alignement was so judiciously taken up, that Massena
did not venture to assail it.</p>

<p>While these operations were going on, a furious attack was
repeated on Fuentes d’Onoro. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery,
all were brought to bear—a tremendous cannonade
opened on the devoted village—and the assault was made at
the same moment on flanks and front together. Desperate
fighting in the streets and churchyard took place. The
French feeding the attacking troops with fresh numbers,
pressed the three regiments,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> that held the upper village,
severely;—but after one of the closest and most desperate
combats that has ever been maintained, a bayonet charge of
the 88th decided the contest;<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> and the assailants, notwithstanding
their vastly superior force, were driven with prodigious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
slaughter from Fuentes; the upper village remaining
in possession of its gallant defenders, and the lower in “the
silent occupation of the dead.”</p>

<p>Evening closed the combat. Massena’s columns on the
right were halted—and his sixth division, with which he had
endeavoured to storm Fuentes d’Onoro, withdrawn—the whole
French army bivouacking in the order in which they had
stood when the engagement closed. The British lighted their
fires, posted their pickets, and occupied the field they had so
bravely held; and “both parties lay down to rest, with a
confident assurance on their minds, that the battle was only
intermitted till the return of daylight.”</p>

<p>A brigade of the light division relieved the brave defenders
of Fuentes,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> and preparatory to the expected renewal of
attack, they threw up some works to defend the upper village
and the ground behind it. But these precautions were
unnecessary; Massena remained for the next day in front of
his antagonist—exhibiting no anxiety to renew the combat.
The 7th found the British, as usual, under arms at dawn, but
the day passed as quietly as the preceding one had done. On
the 8th, however, the French columns were observed in full
retreat, marching on the road to Ciudad Rodrigo. Massena,
with an army reinforced by every battalion and squadron he
could collect from Gallicia and Castile, had been completely
beaten by a wing of the British army, consisting of three
divisions only. With that unblushing assurance, for which
the French marshals have been remarkable, of changing
defeat into conquest, Massena did not hesitate to call Fuentes
d’Onoro a victory. But the object for which the battle was
fought was unattained—he failed in succouring the beleaguered
city—and Almeida was left to its fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
In a close and sanguinary contest, like that of Fuentes
d’Onoro, the loss on both sides must necessarily be immense.
The British had two hundred killed, one thousand and twenty-eight
wounded, and two hundred and ninety-four missing.
The French suffered much more heavily; and it was computed
that nearly five thousand of Massena’s army were rendered
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. In the lower village of Fuentes alone, two
hundred dead bodies were reckoned.</p>

<p>In the conduct of an affair which terminated so gloriously
for the divisions engaged, the system of defence adopted by
Lord Wellington was very masterly. Every arm of his force
was happily employed, and all were well combined for mutual
protection. Massena had every advantage for arranging his
attack—for thick woods in front enabled him to form his
columns unseen—and until the moment of their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débouchement</i>,
none could tell their strength, or even guess the place on which
they were about to be directed. Hence, the French marshal
had the means of pouring a mass of infantry on any point he
pleased—and of making a serious impression before troops
could be moved forward to meet and repel the assault. His
superiority in cavalry and artillery was great. He might,
under a cannonade that the British guns could not have
answered, have brought forward his cavalry <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>, supported
by columns of infantry,—and the allied line, under a
masked movement of this kind, would in all probability have
been penetrated. Or, by bringing his cavalry round the right of
the British flank, and crossing the Coa, he might have obliged
Lord Wellington to pass the river under the greatest disadvantages.
Indeed, this was apprehended on the 5th—and
there was but one alternative, either to raise the blockade of
Almeida, or relinquish the Sabugal road. The latter was
done. “It was a bold measure, but it was not adopted without
due consideration; and it received an ample reward in the
successful termination of this hard-fought battle.”</p>

<p>Although the French moved so slowly on the Rodrigo road
during the 9th, that it seemed a doubtful point whether this
dubious retreat did not mask some other plan of Massena
against the British position, the morning of the 10th dispelled
all anxiety on that head—for then it was ascertained, that
nothing but a few cavalry pickets remained on the line of the
Azava.</p>

<p>Wellington, liberated from all fear of present annoyance,
after strengthening the position at Fuentes with field-works,
resumed the blockade of Almeida. To the sixth division,
under General Campbell, that duty was intrusted—for, unfortunately,
as the event turned out, that officer asked and
obtained permission to reduce the place.</p>

<p>Too great confidence, either in the allied strength or the
weakness of the garrison, most probably led him to adopt an
imperfect system of blockade, which led to mortifying results.
His dispositions were entirely erroneous. It is true that the
right face of Almeida was vigilantly watched—but there, no
movements could have been made with any prospect of succeeding—while
the left unfortunately, was overlooked—and
the banks of the Aqueda and bridge of Barba del Puerco, on
the direct route to the French outposts, were left unguarded.
This oversight was generally noticed—and though the blockade
of the fortress had been in the first instance unreservedly
confided to Campbell, the faulty method of his dispositions
obliged Lord Wellington to order the division of Sir William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Erskine to march and observe the left face of the place. But
this was not effected in proper time—and a delay in the
transmission of orders produced a very annoying result, and
enabled the French garrison to get away.</p>

<p>Massena, on crossing the Agueda, finding every effort to
relieve the fortress impracticable, abandoned it to its fate,
resigning thus the object for which he had sacrificed five
thousand men, and at the same time, losing his last hold in
Portugal. He transmitted orders to Brennier by a private
soldier, who with great tact avoided the British posts, and
reached Almeida safely. In these, the governor was directed
to dismantle the works, quit the fortress in silence, force his
way through the pickets, and march on Barba del Puerco,
where a division of French cavalry and infantry would be
ready to protect him.</p>

<p>The successful issue of the attempt, beleaguered as Almeida
was by a force of such strength as the allied army, appeared a
hopeless task; but to the brave nothing is impossible, and the
bold movement of Brennier obtained the good fortune which
it deserved. Instantly, he proceeded to destroy the works—and
wasted the ammunition, spiked the guns, or more effectually
destroyed them, by discharging one cannon into another.
Frequent explosions were heard during the 8th and 9th, announcing
that the work of destruction was proceeding. This,
however, was only believed to be an act preparatory to an
unconditional surrender—and this added to the ill-judged confidence
of the general who was intrusted with the observation
of the town.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 10th the French governor assembled
his superior officers, communicated Massena’s instructions, and
then issued his own. The soldiers were ordered to quit the
town at ten o’clock—march in profound silence—and no matter
what circumstances should occur, they were directed to receive
the fire of the besiegers without returning a shot. By daylight
Brennier calculated that they should have reached the
bridge—but if delayed by accident, or attacked in force,
the way was to be opened with the bayonet. The night
march was pointed out from the ramparts—and at eleven
o’clock, under cover of an immense explosion, the brave band<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
left the ruined fortress, and guided by the stars, pushed boldly
for the French lines.</p>

<p>The springing of the mines was not particularly attended to—for
on the preceding nights similar explosions had been
heard. But suddenly a report was spread that Almeida was
deserted—and that the garrison, with Brennier at their head,
were marching rapidly on Barba del Puerco.</p>

<p>The pickets of Pack’s brigade were at Malpartada; and that
general, in visiting his outposts, first ascertained the escape of
the French, and gave an alarm. It was now too late—the
first picket that opposed the garrison of Almeida had been
bayoneted—and pushing through the others, who could offer
but trifling opposition, Brennier marched rapidly on. Pack
sent immediately to apprise Campbell of the occurrence, and
in person he hung on the enemy’s rear, indicating the line of
the retreat by the flashes of his musketry, which were constantly
kept up. Campbell, though he hurried to the point,
appears to have issued no distinct orders, which should have
produced an instant pursuit. The 4th regiment endeavoured
to head the retreating column—but the latter marched too rapidly
to be overtaken. Brennier’s orders were strictly obeyed—the
column hurried on—and not a shot was fired until it
reached the Aqueda.</p>

<p>There the French halted for their stragglers to come up, for
they had also diverged a little to the left of the proper route.
These delays enabled the 2nd, 4th, and 36th, who had thrown
aside their knapsacks, to overtake them in the act of crossing
the bridge at Puerco. In passing they were exposed to a
heavy fire, by which they lost one hundred men—while some
squadrons of the Royals, and Pack’s Portuguese light troops,
captured ten officers and upwards of two hundred men.</p>

<p>The retreat of the garrison from Almeida was admirably
planned and bravely executed. Three-fourths of the number
were thus saved—and the doubt is, whether Massena’s astonishment
or Wellington’s annoyance at Brennier’s escape, was
the greater. Indeed, fewer prosperous results succeeded the
battle of Fuentes d’Onoro than might have been reasonably
looked for. But such events are ever occurring, and form the
proverbial uncertainty of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la fortune de la guerre</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
A general order of Lord Wellington, in alluding to this
singular escape, sensibly remarks—“Officers of the army may
depend upon it, that the enemy to whom they are opposed is
not less prudent than powerful.” The extreme ability with
which Brennier had contrived not only to ruin the works,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
but to pass his garrison in close column through the quarters
of the reserves, proved the truth of Lord Wellington’s estimate
of the military ability of his opponents. Lord Londonderry,
in noticing Brennier’s exploit, says, “Not that we very deeply
regretted the escape of the individuals; they were brave men,
had made a bold venture, and deserved that it should be
crowned with success.” A remark we should have expected
from a man, himself a stout and dashing officer.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>While Lord Wellington had been obliged to return to the
north, in consequence of Massena’s movements for the relief of
Almeida, Beresford endeavoured to reduce Badajoz, and selected,
as its weakest point, the junction of the Rivellas with
the Guadiana, where the defences were restricted to a simple
wall in front of the castle that commands the town.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
marshal had hopes from the engineers, that the place might be
taken in twelve or fourteen days. Preparations for the siege
were made; bridges laid across the Guadiana on the 23rd—and
the next day was appointed for a close investment of
the fortress. That evening, unfortunately, the weather changed
suddenly—the flood rose—the river in one night increased
perpendicularly seven feet—and sweeping the bridges totally
away, the materials were borne down the stream, and the
communications with Portugal completely interrupted.</p>

<p>Another bridge was hastily constructed. On the 8th, ground
was broken—and notwithstanding the rocky surface, moonlight,
and the exposed situation on which the working parties
were employed, occasioned heavy loss, a breaching battery
opened on San Christoval on the 11th at daybreak. Its operation
was found very indifferent. The Portuguese gunners
who manned the batteries were, from their inexperience, unable
to produce effect; the guns, also, were defective<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the firing of a few hours left them, with one exception, totally
unserviceable.</p>

<p>At this time, intelligence reached the marshal, that Soult
was marching from Larena. Beresford, of course, at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
abandoned the siege, removed the artillery and stores, and
having united himself with Blake, Castanos, and Ballasteros,
the combined armies took position behind the Albuera, where
the Seville and Olivença roads separate.</p>

<p>On the westward of the ground where the allies determined
to abide a battle, the surface undulated gently—and on the
summit, and parallel with the river, their divisions were drawn
up. The village of Albuera was in front of the left, and the
right was formed on a succession of knolls, none of them of
any strength, and having no particular appui. On the eastern
side of the river, an open country extends for a considerable
distance, terminating in thick woods; and in these Soult
bivouacked on the night of the 15th, and there made his dispositions
for attack.</p>

<p>The French army, though numerically weaker, was composed
of veteran troops, and amounted to twenty thousand
infantry, three thousand cavalry, and forty pieces of cannon.
The allies numbered twenty-seven thousand infantry, two
thousand cavalry, and thirty-two guns; but of this force, fourteen
thousand were Spanish.</p>

<p>These last were formed in a double line upon the right—Stewart’s
division was in the centre—a Portuguese division
on the left. The light infantry, under Alten, held the village—and
the dragoons, under Lumley, were placed on the right
flank of the Spaniards. Cole’s division (the fusileers) and a
Portuguese brigade, which came up after the action had commenced,
were formed in rear of the centre.</p>

<p>Never did the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of an army so completely compensate
for its inferior numbers as that of the Duke of Dalmatia.
What though his infantry was weaker by eight or even ten
thousand, his were among the finest battalions in the service
of Napoleon. His cavalry was a third stronger, and his artillery
more numerous and efficient. Beresford’s was a medley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of three nations. He had thirty thousand men in position, but
not a fourth was British; while nearly one-half was composed
of that worst of military mobs—the Spaniards—nor were these
even brought up in time to admit of their being properly
posted. Blake had promised that his corps should be on the
hill of Albuera before noon on the 15th—and, with but a few
miles to march, with excellent roads to traverse, the head of
his columns reached the ground near midnight, and the rear
at three on the morning of the 16th. Bad as Beresford’s
army was, had it been in hand, more might have been done
with it. It was three o’clock on the 16th before Blake was
fairly up, and six before the fourth division reached the ground;
while three fine British regiments under Kemmis, and Madden’s
Portuguese cavalry, never appeared. As the event
shewed, a few British soldiers would have proved invaluable—and
these troops, though immediately contiguous during
the long and doubtful struggle that ensued, remained <em>non-combatant</em>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_22">BATTLE OF ALBUERA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Soult attacks the Spaniards.—Progress of the battle.—French defeated.—Remarks
on Marshal Beresford.—Blake’s conduct.—Soult retreats.—Badajoz
invested.</p></blockquote>

<p>Beresford’s position had been carefully reconnoitred by
Soult on the evening of the 15th, and aware that the fourth
British division was still before Badajoz, and Blake not yet
come up, he determined to attack the marshal without delay.
A height, commanding the Valverde road, if a front attack were
made, appeared, on his examination of the ground, to be the
key of the position; and as Beresford had overlooked its
occupation, Soult ably selected it as the point by which his
principal effort should be made.</p>

<p>A wooded hill behind the Albuera, and within cannon-shot
of the allied right, afforded the French marshal the means of
forming a strong column for attack, without his design being
noticed by his opponent. Covered by the darkness, he
brought forward the artillery of Ruty, the fifth corps under
Girard, with the cavalry of Latour Maubourg, and formed
them for his intended assault; “thus concentrating fifteen
thousand men and forty guns within ten minutes’ march of
Beresford’s right wing, and yet that general could neither see
a man, nor draw a sound conclusion as to the real plan of
attack.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> The remainder of his corps was placed in the
wood on the banks of the Feria, to bear against Beresford’s
left, and by carrying the bridge and village sever the wings of
the allied army.</p>

<p>The engagement commenced by Godinot debouching from
the wood, and making a feint on the left, while the main body
of the French ascended the heights on the right of the
Spaniards. On perceiving the true object of Soult’s attack,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Beresford, who had vainly endeavoured, through an aide-de-camp,
to persuade Blake to change his front, rode to the
Spanish post, pointed out the heads of the advancing columns,
and induced his ally to take up a new alignement. It was
scarcely done until the French bore down upon the Spanish
infantry; and though at first they were stoutly opposed, the
battalions gradually began to yield ground; and, being farther
forced back, Soult commenced deploying on the most commanding
point of the position. A serious attack was to be
dreaded; the French cavalry sweeping round the allies,
threatened their rear—and Godinot’s column made fresh
demonstrations of vigorously assailing the left.</p>

<p>All this was most alarming;—the Spanish line confusedly
endeavouring to effect the difficult manœuvre of changing its
front, while two-thirds of the French, in compact order of
battle, were preparing to burst upon the disordered ranks, and
insure their total destruction. The French guns had opened a
furious cannonade,—the infantry were firing volley after
volley,—the cavalry charging where the Spanish battalions
seemed most disordered. Already their ranks were
wavering—and Soult, determined to complete the ruin he
had begun, ordered up the reserve, and advanced all his
batteries.</p>

<p>At this perilous moment, when the day seemed lost, General
Stewart pushed the leading brigade of the fourth division up
the hill under Colonel Colborne, and it mounted by columns
of companies. To form line on gaining the top, under a
withering fire, was difficult; and while in the act of its being
effected, a mist, accompanied by a heavy fall of rain, shut
every object out from view, and enabled the whole of the light
cavalry of Godinot’s division to sweep round the right flank,
and gallop on the rear of the companies, at the time they were
in loose deployment. Half the brigade was cut to pieces—the
31st, who were still fortunately in column, alone escaping
the lancers, who, with little resistance, were spearing right and
left a body of men surprised on an open flat, and wanting the
necessary formation which can alone enable infantry to resist a
charge of horse.</p>

<p>This scene of slaughter, by a partial dispersion of the smoke
and fog that had hitherto concealed the battle-ground, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
fortunately observed by General Lumley, and he ordered the
British cavalry to gallop to the relief of the remnant of Colborne’s
brigade. They charged boldly; and, in turn, the
lancers were taken in rear, and many fell beneath the sabres
of the English.</p>

<p>The weather, that had caused the destruction of the British
regiments, obscured the field of battle, and prevented Soult
from taking an immediate advantage by exterminating that
half-ruined brigade. Stewart brought up Houghton’s corps;
the artillery had come forward, and opened a furious cannonade
on the dense masses of the French; and the 31st resolutely
maintained its position on the height. Two Spanish brigades
were advanced, and the action became hotter than ever. For
a moment the French battalions recoiled,—but it was only to
rally instantly, and come on with greater fury. A raging fire
of artillery on both sides, sustained at little more than pistol
range, with reiterated volleys of musketry, heaped the field
with dead—while the French were vainly endeavouring to
gain ground, and the British would not yield an inch. But
the ranks of the island soldiery were thinning fast,—their
ammunition was nearly exhausted,—their fire slackened,—and
notwithstanding the cannonade checked the French movement
for a time, Soult formed a column on the right flank of
the British, and the lancers<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> charging furiously again, drove
off the artillery-men and captured six guns. All now seemed
lost—and a retreat appeared inevitable. The Portuguese
were preparing to cover it, and the marshal was about to give
the order, when Colonel Hardinge suggested that another
effort should be made, and “boldly ordered General Cole to
advance, and then riding to Colonel Abercrombie, who commanded
the remaining brigade of the second division, directed
him also to push forward into the fight.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>The order was instantly obeyed,—General Harvey, with
the Portuguese regiments of the fourth division, moved on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
between the British cavalry and the hill; and though charged
home by the French dragoons, he checked them by a heavy
fire and pushed forward steadily; while General Cole led on
the 7th and 23rd fusileers in person.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the remnant of the British must
have abandoned the hill or perished. The French reserve was
on its march to assist the front column of the enemy, while,
with the allies all was in confusion; and as if the slaughter
required an increase, a Spanish and an English regiment were
firing in mutual mistake upon each other. Six guns were in
possession of the French, and their lancers, riding furiously
over the field, threatened the feeble remnant of the British
still in line, and speared the wounded without mercy.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> At
this fearful moment the boundless gallantry of British officers
displayed itself; Colonel Arbuthnot, under the double musketry,
rushed between the mistaken regiments, and stopped
the firing; Cole pushed up the hill, scattered the lancers,
recovered the guns, and passed the right of the skeleton of
Houghton’s brigade, at the same instant that Abercrombie
appeared upon its left. Leaving the broken regiments in its
rear, the fusileer brigade came forward with imposing gallantry,
and boldly confronted the French, now reinforced by
a part of its reserve, and who were, as they believed, coming
forward to annihilate the “feeble few” that had still survived
the murderous contest. From the daring attitude of the fresh
regiments, Soult perceived, too late, that the battle was not
yet won; and, under a tremendous fire of artillery, he
endeavoured to break up his close formation and extend his
front. For a moment the storm of grape, poured from Ruty’s
well-served artillery, staggered the fusileers,—but it was only
for a moment. Though Soult rushed into the thickest of the
fire, and encouraged and animated his men,—though the
cavalry gathered on their flank and threatened it with destruction,
on went these noble regiments; volley after volley
falling into the crowded ranks of their enemy, and cheer after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
cheer pealing to Heaven, in answer to the clamorous outcry
of the French, as the boldest urged the others forward.</p>

<p>Nothing could check the fusileers; they kept gradually
advancing, while the incessant rolling of their musketry
slaughtered the crowded sections of the French, and each
moment embarrassed more and more Soult’s efforts to open out
his encumbered line. The reserve, coming to support their
comrades—now forced to the very edge of the plateau—increased
the crowd without remedying the disorder. The
English volleys rolled on faster and more deadly than ever;
a horrid carnage made all attempts to hold the hill vain—and
uselessly increased an unavailing slaughter. Unable to bear
the withering fire, the shattered columns of the French were
no longer able to sustain themselves,—the mass were driven
over the ridge,—and trampling each other down, the shattered
column sought refuge at the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>On that bloody height stood the conquerors. From fifteen
hundred muskets a parting volley fell upon the routed column
as it hurried down the Sierra. Where was the remainder of
the proud army of England, that on the morning had exceeded
six thousand combatants?—Stretched coldly in the sleep of
death, or bleeding on the battle-ground!</p>

<p>During the time this desperate effort of the fusileer brigade
had been in progress, Beresford, to assist Hardinge, moved
Blake’s first line on Albuera—and with the German light
troops, and two Portuguese divisions, advanced to support the
7th and 23rd, while Lautour Maubourg’s flank attack was
repelled by the fire of Lefebre’s guns, and a threatened charge
by Lumley. But the fusileers had driven the French over
the heights before any assistance reached them—and Beresford
was enabled to form a fresh line upon the hill, parallel to that
by which Soult had made his attack in the morning. For a
short time the battle continued at Albuera—but the French
finally withdrew from the village, and at three o’clock in the
evening, the firing had totally ceased.</p>

<p>There is not on record a bloodier struggle. In four hours’
fighting, fifteen thousand men were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. The
allied loss was frightful; it amounted to nearly seven thousand
in killed, wounded, and missing. Almost all its general
officers were included in the melancholy list: Houghton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Myers, and Duckworth in the killed; and Cole, Stewart,
Ellis, Blakeney, and Hawkshaw among the wounded. The
loss of some regiments was terrible; the 57th came into action
with five hundred and seventy bayonets—and at the close it
had lost its colonel (Inglis), twenty-two officers, and four
hundred rank and file. The proportion of the allied casualties
told how fatal Albuera had proved to the British: two thousand
Spaniards, and six hundred German and Portuguese,
were returned as their killed and wounded, leaving the
remainder to be completed from the British regiments.
Hence, the unexampled loss of more than four thousand men,
out of a corps little exceeding six, was sustained in this sanguinary
battle by the British.</p>

<p>Never was more heroism displayed than by the British
regiments engaged in the murderous conflict of Albuera. The
soldiers dropped by whole ranks, but never thought of turning.
When a too ardent wish to succour those pressed upon
the hill, induced Stewart to hurry Colborne’s brigade into
action, without allowing it a momentary pause to halt and
form,—and in the mist, that unluckily favoured the lancer
charge, the companies were unexpectedly assailed,—though
fighting at dreadful disadvantage, the men resisted to the last.
Numbers perished by the lance-blade; but still the dead
Poles, that were found intermingled with the fallen English,
shewed that the gallant islanders had not died without exacting
blood for blood.</p>

<p>The French exceeded the British by at least a thousand.
Of their worst wounded, eight hundred were left upon the
field. Their loss in superior officers, like that of the British,
had been most severe—two generals having been killed, and
three severely wounded.</p>

<p>To a victory both sides laid claim—the French resting theirs
on the capture of some colours, the taking of a howitzer, with
some five hundred prisoners whom they had secured unwounded.
But the British kept the battle-ground; and though neither
cannon nor eagle remained with them, a field covered with carcases,
and heaped with bleeding enemies, was the best trophy
of their valour, and clearly established to whom conquest in
reality belonged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Much military controversy has arisen from the fight of
Albuera—and Marshal Beresford has received some praise and
more censure. Probably the battle should not have been
fought at all; or, if it were unavoidable, greater care might
have been bestowed in taking the position—and, certainly, the
investment of Badajoz should not have been continued so long.
Much, however, can be urged in favour of Marshal Beresford—for
his was a most embarrassing command, and he had numerous
and unexpected difficulties to contend with. Opposed to
him was one of the ablest of Napoleon’s generals, and an army
formed of the finest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i>, complete in every arm, and under
the orders of the best officers of France. How differently was
his force constructed:—a small portion of the whole were
British: on another part of it, the Portuguese, some fair reliance
might be placed; but the half of his army were an ill-commanded
and ill-disciplined force, half-starved, half-armed, worn
down by fatigue, and beaten repeatedly by the very troops
they were again obliged to encounter. Little dependence could
be placed on such worthless levies—and still less on their stubborn
commander. When the real attack of the French marshal
was apparent to everybody, Blake, with proverbial obstinacy,
refused to alter his formation until his clumsy battalions
had not sufficient time to change their front, and the French
columns were actually mounting the hill to attack him. This
was bad enough, yet, after all, it was but an error of the head.
But the man was radically worthless. When Beresford’s
pickets had been established for the night, the British brigades
were so miserably reduced, that they could not furnish men
to carry off the wounded. In this wretched situation, when
an enemy would have freely succoured him, Beresford despatched
Hardinge to his ally, to beg him to lend assistance;
and the brutal answer of the Spaniard was, “that each of the
allied powers must take care of its own wounded;” and he
declined extending the least relief to these heroic sufferers,
who, by a prodigal expenditure of their blood, alone had saved
his sluggish legions from extermination.</p>

<p>If Beresford’s judgment be open to censure, his personal
intrepidity must be admitted and admired. No man could
make greater exertions to retrieve the day when defeat appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
all but certain. When Stewart’s imprudence, in loosely
bringing Colborne’s brigade into action, had occasioned it a loss
only short of annihilation,—and the Spaniards, though they
could not be induced to advance, fired without ceasing, with an
English regiment in their front, Beresford actually seized an
ensign and dragged him forward with the colours, hoping that
these worthless troops would be inspirited to follow. Not a man
stirred—and the standard-bearer, when the marshal’s grasp
relaxed, instantly flew back to herd with his cold-blooded associates.
In every change of the fight, and on every part of
the field, Beresford was seen conspicuously; and whatever
might have been his failing as a general, his bravery as a man
should have commanded the respect of many who treated his
arrangements with unsparing severity.</p>

<p>A painful night succeeded that sanguinary day. The moaning
of the wounded and the groans of the dying were heard on
every side; and it was to be dreaded that Soult, who had still
fifteen thousand troops fit for action, would renew the battle.
On the next day, however, three fresh British regiments joined
the marshal by a forced march; and on the 18th, Soult retreated
on the road of Solano, covered by the heavy cavalry of
Lautour Maubourg. He had previously despatched such of his
wounded as could bear removal towards Seville, leaving the
remainder to the generous protection of the British commander.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Badajoz was partially blockaded on the 19th, by the Portuguese,
under General Hamilton. On the second day after,
Lord Wellington arrived, and ordered up the third and seventh
divisions to complete the investment of that important fortress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Soult continued retreating, and Beresford followed him, by
order of the allied commander.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_23">SIEGE OF BADAJOZ, AND AFFAIR
OF EL BODON.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Badajoz besieged.—Castle breached and unsuccessfully assaulted.—A
second attempt fails.—Siege raised.—French advance.—Badajoz relieved.—Montbrun
attacks the allies.—Affair of El Bodon.—Wellington’s
dangerous situation.—He retreats on the Coa—Offers battle
there, which Soult and Marmont decline.—French retire.</p></blockquote>

<p>It certainly was a bold design, and one that many considered
as little removed from rashness, for Lord Wellington to attempt
Badajoz a second time, limited as he was in every necessary
for a siege, and by no means secure from molestation. He
had obtained, by the victories of Fuentes d’Onoro and Albuera,
a temporary superiority of force on the Guadiana; but it was
not likely that Soult and Marmont would let a fortress to which
they attached so much importance fall, without making a
vigorous effort for its relief—nor could a rapid reduction of
Badajoz be accomplished. The siege trains were wretchedly
defective; and the guns, originally bad, had been ruined or
disabled during Beresford’s recent attempt; and the engineers
reported, that eleven days would be required before they could
be remounted and placed in battery; while in twenty, a force
quite sufficient to disturb all operations, could easily reach the
Alemtejo from Salamanca, by the passes of Banos or Gata, while
the Tagus was fordable at Alcantara.</p>

<p>Operations commenced on the night of the 30th of May, in
front of the castle, by sixteen hundred workmen, covered by a
protecting party of twelve hundred. The first parallel, extending
one thousand yards, was completed, and no interruption
given by the besieged. A lesser party commenced a parallel
before San Christoval; but the rocky soil could not be broken
without causing alarm, and a severe fire was directed on the
workmen, which occasioned a considerable loss.</p>

<p>The approaches were ably pushed on, but great difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
had to be overcome by the besiegers. Before San Christoval,
the stony surface required a supply of earth and woolpacks, to
form an artificial covering for the engineers and fatigue parties;
while the workmen were exposed to the fire of several sixteen
and eighteen inch mortars, which threw their enormous shells
with a precision that threatened ruin to every thing within their
range.</p>

<p>When the batteries opened on the morning of the 3rd of
June, the imperfect supply of bullets was soon exhausted, and
the artillery were obliged to use the shot intended for guns of
an inferior calibre—consequently, the windage was so great,
that the service was very indifferent; and several guns, from
the defective quality of their metal, became unserviceable after
a few discharges.</p>

<p>A siege, where the means of aggression were so imperfect,
could only have been carried on by the unremitted exertions
of every arm engaged—and with various casualties, that of
Badajoz continued until the 6th, when two breaches in San
Christoval were reported practicable; and it was decided by
Lord Wellington that they should be stormed without loss of
time.</p>

<p>All was accordingly prepared; the storming party gained
the ditch, but the foot of the breach had been cleared, and a
sheer ascent of full seven feet of wall unexpectedly presented
itself. Without sufficient means for escalade, success was hopeless—and
the more prudent plan would have been to retire
instantly, when the actual state of the breach was ascertained.
But British blood was roused; the assailants were bravely
led,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> and for nearly an hour, in an unavailing effort to surmount
an impracticable barrier, the forlorn hope and storming
party persevered, until three-fourths of their number were destroyed.
Nothing had been omitted by the enemy both for
defence and annoyance. The rubbish had been cleared away,
and the parapet lined with shells, grenades, stones, and powder-bags,
which were rolled into the ditch, and by their repeated
explosions, destroyed all within their reach. After desperate
but unavailing exertions, the few that remained were withdrawn,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
with some iron guns which had been obtained,
the engineers immediately resumed breaching the castle walls.</p>

<p>The fire speedily brought down the ancient masonry, and a
bank of clay against which the wall had been erected. An
engineer officer examined the breach, and reported that it was
practicable—although he received his death-wound in the
attempt, and had only strength left to announce that he had
done the duty on which he had been employed. But the besieged
were indefatigable in repairing by night, the damages
their works received from the English batteries, and the breach
was provided with every means for desperate defence. A
more vigorous assault was arranged, and a better hour was
selected; the troops were equally ardent and as boldly led—but
the result was similar; and the second assault failed with
as great a loss of life, and as little chance of succeeding, as that
which marked the former storm.</p>

<p>It was now quite apparent that additional siege artillery
must be procured to insure the fall of Badajoz; while information
was received by Lord Wellington, that Soult and
Marmont were making rapid movements to relieve the fortress.
To persevere longer would have been madness;—the siege
was therefore, necessarily raised, and the guns and stores removed
without any molestation. A blockade was established;
and while the Spaniards were sent across the Guadiana, to
operate against the French posts, Lord Wellington took a
position in front of Albuera. On the 19th, the allies retired
on the Caya, and Soult’s advanced guard entered Badajoz.</p>

<p>The united force of the French marshals was greatly superior,
particularly in cavalry, to that of Wellington;<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> but the
Caya afforded a strong position, and the British general determined
to abide a battle.</p>

<p>A <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i> by Soult and Marmont, on the 22nd of
June, induced a belief that an action would result. Wellington,
with admirable tact, kept his masses out of sight, and the
marshals failed in discovering his dispositions. The British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
bivouacs were in the woods contiguous to the river:—head-quarters
at Vicente, Hill’s corps at Torre de More on the right,
and Picton’s division, on the left, at Campo Mayor.</p>

<p>On the same morning that the French marshals had examined
the allied position, a strong cavalry force was detached
from the enemy’s posts, to cross the Guadiana and move
towards Elvas. Nothing would have particularly marked
this demonstration, had not an English picket of sixty men,
with three officers, been cut off and made prisoners, by mistaking
the French for Portuguese dragoons. The absurd
fancy indulged in at home, of imitating foreign patterns in
clothing the cavalry, led to numerous mistakes; while it
greatly embarrassed officers, in ascertaining correctly whether
troops, when at a trifling distance, were in reality friends or
foes.</p>

<p>For a month the French marshals remained together; their
numerous cavalry scouring the face of the country to an immense
extent, and wasting it of every thing that was convertible
into sustenance for either men or horses. At last, these
precarious supplies, obtained from an impoverished country,
failed altogether; and Soult and Marmont retired from Estramadura,—the
latter, marching northwards, and the former
falling back upon Seville.</p>

<p>On this movement being made, Wellington instantly changed
his quarters, first to Portalegre, and afterwards to Fuente
Guinaldo. The occupation of the posts and villages contiguous
to Ciudad Rodrigo, must, of necessity, cut off from
that garrison every chance of a casual supply; while the distance
of the French cantonments (sixty miles) would make it
impossible for either of the marshals to introduce a convoy,
unless it were accompanied and protected by an entire <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps
d’armée</i>. Wellington had calculated on these difficulties; his
plans were soundly conceived; and they were carried out with
that steady resolution, which has always characterized the
greatest general that Britain ever claimed.</p>

<p>As had been anticipated, Ciudad Rodrigo became exceedingly
straitened; and the French marshals, at great inconvenience,
were obliged to concentrate at Salamanca, to cover the
introduction of supplies, which at every cost, must be thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
into the fortress. Rumour, of course, was busy; one report
making them fifty thousand, and another swelling their numbers
to eighty. The allied general, however, determined to
retain his cantonments; and the position of Guinaldo was
strengthened by field-works; while the different divisions
were posted so as to admit of speedy concentration. On the
right bank of the Agueda, the light division guarded the Sierra
de Gata,—while Picton held the more advanced position of El
Bodon.</p>

<p>The position was too extensive to be strong—and its communications
were liable to interruption, as the fords of the
Agueda were frequently rendered impassable by sudden rains.
The heights of El Bodon and Pastores were on either side
encircled by plains, partially wooded, and reaching from Rodrigo
to the Coa. Hence, the position was unsafe; for, if its
flanks were turned, the retirement of a corps that held it on
Guinaldo, would have become a very doubtful matter.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, the French moved forward from Tamames,
and reconnoitred the British position; and on the next day
they pushed a convoy into Badajoz, protected by four divisions
of infantry and six thousand cavalry. On the 25th, the English
pickets were driven across the Azava—while crossing the
Agueda in great force, Montbrun moved directly on Guinaldo,
and turned the heights on which Picton’s division had been
posted. Considerably detached, as from the extent of the
position the British regiments necessarily were, their situation
became all but desperate. Picton, with the right brigade, was
at El Bodon; two regiments at Pastores; while the 5th and
77th British, the 21st Portuguese, two brigades of guns, and
three squadrons of German and English cavalry, occupied the
height over which the Guinaldo road passes.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington ordered up assistance, on perceiving how
dangerously the third division was circumstanced; but before
any reached the scene of action, its own and often-tried resource
had saved it,—the daring gallantry, that neither an
isolated situation nor an overwhelming enemy could disturb.</p>

<p>The advance of the French cavalry was beautiful; the sun
shone brilliantly out, and as their numerous squadrons, in long
array, approached the heights occupied by the British infantry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
nothing could be more imposing than their military attitude.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
The cool and steady determination with which Colville’s brigade
waited the enemy’s attack was truly British. While the
French masses were defiling along the road, the English infantry
remained in columns of battalions behind the ridge, and
the cavalry stood dismounted—each dragoon with the bridle
on his arm, and apparently as careless to coming events, as if
he were on the parade-ground of his barrack, waiting for the
trumpet call to “fall in.” But when the advanced squadrons
were about to mount the ridge, the infantry formed line; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
dragoons sprang to their saddles; and the artillery, which had
occasionally cannonaded the hostile squadrons as they came
within their range, opened with additional spirit, and poured
from the height a torrent of grape and case shot that occasioned
a serious loss to the enemy.</p>

<p>The French appeared to feel sensibly the effect produced by
the fire, and a brigade cheered and charged up the heights.
The men stood by their guns to the last, but eventually they
were obliged to retire—and the French dragoons gained the
battery, and the cannon were taken.</p>

<p>Their possession by the enemy was but for a moment. The
5th regiment came steadily forward in line, and after delivering
a shattering volley, lowered their bayonets, and boldly
advanced to charge the cavalry. This—the first instance of
horsemen being assailed by infantry in line—was brilliantly
successful. The French were hurried down the height—and
the guns recaptured, were limbered up, and brought away.</p>

<p>Nor on the other side of the position were the British and
German cavalry less gloriously engaged. Again and again, the
French dragoons charged up the hill—and as regularly were
they met sword to sword, repulsed and beaten back.</p>

<p>But the hill could not be held with such inferior numbers
as the British. A column of great strength got unperceived in
the rear of the right—not a moment could be lost—and an
instant retreat was unavoidable. Indeed, the escape of these
devoted regiments seemed hopeless. Montbrun brought forward
overwhelming numbers against the left flank—and the
French dragoons had cut the right off from its communication
with El Bodon. The 83rd united itself with the 5th and
77th, and the Portuguese 21st had already commenced retreating,
and gained the plain. The cavalry, finding itself
almost surrounded, galloped off at speed—and the British regiments
were left alone, to save themselves or perish.</p>

<p>They reached the plain,—Montbrun’s numerous squadrons
came on with loud huzzas, and in such force, that the annihilation
of these weak battalions seemed inevitable. But the
French had yet to learn of what stern stuff the British soldier
is composed. In a moment, the 5th and 77th formed square,
and in steady silence awaited the coming onset. The charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
was made—the cheering of the dragoons pealed over the
battle-field as they came on at speed, and with a fiery determination
that nothing could withstand. Against every face of
the square a hostile squadron galloped; the earth shook—the
cheers rose louder—another moment of that headlong
speed must bring the dragoons upon the bayonets of the
kneeling front rank. Then, from the British square a shattering
volley was poured in,—the smoke cleared away,—and,
but a few yards from the faces of the square, men and horses
were rolling on the plain in death. The charge was repulsed—the
ranks disordered—and the French dragoons, recoiling
from that fearless array which they had vainly striven to penetrate,
rode hastily off to reform their broken ranks, and
remove themselves from an incessant stream of musketry that
had already proved so fatal.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Picton had disengaged the regiments of
the right brigade from the enclosures of El Bodon, and joined
the 5th and 77th—and the whole retreated across the plain
in beautiful order, presenting so bold an attitude, whenever
the French made any demonstrations of charging, that they
never attempted to close on the squares again. Still, Montbrun
hung upon the rear and flanks of the allies, maintaining
a trifling cannonade—while his guns were warmly replied to
by the English artillery. On getting near Guinaldo, a support
of both infantry and cavalry came forward—and the
French abandoned the pursuit, after being roughly handled by
the fire of the British musketry, and the bold charges of the
few squadrons on the field, whose conduct all through that
trying day had been most gallant.</p>

<p>The British position was infinitely too extensive for divisions
weak as those of Cole and Picton to hold with safety.
Lord Wellington had therefore decided on retiring to the Coa,
and halt there upon his selected battle-ground; but unfortunately
the light division had taken a mountain route instead
of fording the Agueda; and General Craufurd, ignorant that
Gata and Perales were in possession of the French, was
marching directly on the enemy. This mistake might have
not only occasioned the loss of the light division, but seriously
endangered Cole and Picton at Guinaldo. Nor was the alarm
lessened on the morning of the 26th, when Marmont got under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
arms, and exhibited sixty thousand splendid troops,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> within
little more than cannon-shot of the two isolated divisions who
held the heights above. Fortunately, the French marshal
had little suspicion of his rival’s weakness, and amused himself
with manœuvring his splendid army, instead of overwhelming
the allied brigades, which were completely within
his reach—alone and unsupported.</p>

<p>On the preceding night, the 60th and 74th, who had been
in position at Pastores, and cut off by Montbrun in his attack
on El Bodon, forded the Agueda, moved along its right bank,
and, after an extraordinary march of fifteen hours, reached the
British cantonments in safety. At three in the afternoon, the
light division joined; and at night the whole retired towards
the position where Wellington had resolved to offer battle.</p>

<p>On the 27th, the French pushed forward a strong corps, and
a sharp affair occurred at Aldea de Ponte. The village was
twice carried by the French,—and as often retaken by Pakenham,
with the fusileer brigade and Portuguese Caçadores.</p>

<p>That night Lord Wellington fell back and occupied his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
selected ground. The Coa was in his rear,—his right extending
to the Sierra de Mesas, his centre occupying the village of
Soita, and his left resting on the river at Rendo.</p>

<p>This position was too formidable, from its narrow front, to
be easily assailed, and the enemy declined an attack. Soon
after the French corps separated, and resumed their former
cantonments. Marmont retired on the valley of the Tagus,
Dorsenne fell back on Salamanca, Girard moved to Mafra, and
Foy proceeded to Placentia. The French operations, on the
whole, were a miserable failure. It is true, that Rodrigo was
relieved—but in every other essay their designs had failed;
and Wellington, with an inferior force, completely checked
them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_24">ARROYO DE MOLINOS, AND SIEGE OF TARIFA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Girard invades Estremadura.—Hill marches against him.—Surprises him
at Arroyo de Molinos.—Spanish affairs.—Fall of Tarragona. Proceedings
of the French.—Siege of Tarifa.—Total defeat of Laval.</p></blockquote>

<p>General Hill had established his head-quarters at Portalegre,
and cantoned his division in the surrounding villages.
The position was well chosen; and while it enabled him to
observe Badajoz closely, he had the power of concentrating
his troops at the shortest notice; while no movement of any
consequence could be made by the enemy without the knowledge
of the English general.</p>

<p>After retiring from Ciudad Rodrigo, Soult had turned his
attention against the newly-raised army of Castanos; and
Girard, with a moveable column, was despatched into Estremadura,
to narrow his line of action and cripple his supplies.</p>

<p>Girard’s presence was most injurious, and threatened the
very existence of an army whose means of sustenance must
be drawn from the country alone. Throughout the Peninsular
war, the Spanish commissariate was but a name. Castanos’
support, therefore, depended on his own exertions; and it was
absolutely necessary that the French should be driven from
that portion of Estremadura, or the Spanish general could not
subsist his raw and ill-appointed levies.</p>

<p>That task was consigned to Hill, assisted by some Spanish
troops, under the command of Giron and Penne Villemur.
Apprised of the advance of the allies, Girard fell back from
Aliseda; and, after a cavalry affair with Villemur, he retired,
first to Arroyo Puerco—and then, passing Caceres, marched
on Tollemacha. Hill, on gaining correct intelligence of his
route, proceeded by the shorter road of Aldea de Cano and
Casa Antonio; while Girard, leaving a rear-guard at Albola,
fell back on the morning of the 27th upon Arroyo de Molinos.</p>

<p>This little town stands at the base of a steep and rugged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
mountain, one of the extreme ridges of the Sierra de Montanches.
The height that overlooks it is nearly inaccessible,
forming a crescent behind the town, whose points are about
two miles apart. Beneath the eastern point, the Truxillo
road is carried; while that of Merida runs at right angles
with that of Alcuescar—and the Medellin road between the
former two. A plain stretches between Arroyo and Alcuescar,
interspersed with a few patches of oaks and cork-trees. To
occupy these several roads, and thus cut off Girard’s retreat,
was Hill’s great object. By a forced march he reached
Alcuescar in the evening, lay under arms for the night, moved
at two in the morning, and, undiscovered, halted within half
a mile of the French corps, who were leisurely preparing to
resume their march, and little dreamed of his dangerous
proximity. The bad roads, however, delayed Hill’s advance;
and it was past six o’clock before the columns of attack were
formed.</p>

<p>The first brigade, under Lieutenant-colonel Stewart, was
ordered to attack the town. The second, under Howard,
moved rapidly to the right of Arroyo, and occupied the
Medellin road. Between these columns, the cavalry of Villemur
was posted, to charge, if necessary, or support either
corps that might require it.</p>

<p>The weather, though distressing to the troops, was favourable
for a surprise. It rained heavily, and a storm of wind
was raging. No enemy interrupted the allied advance—for
their outlying picket had returned to the town, as Girard had
ordered his division to march at daybreak.</p>

<p>When the attack was being made, the first French brigade
were filing from the streets of Arroyo by the Merida road,
under a perfect assurance that their march would be unmolested;
when suddenly a dragoon galloped in, announcing
that a body of men were marching rapidly towards the town,
but the mist was too thick to permit their uniform to be seen.</p>

<p>Girard was convinced that these troops were Spanish, and
jocosely remarked, that “Messieurs les Anglois lay too long
a-bed, to be stirring by times on such a morning.” But a few
minutes undeceived him,—a loud cheer was heard, and
instantly the Highland regiments appeared, their bagpipes
playing “Hey, Johnny Cope, are ye waking yet?” They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
entered with unloaded muskets—the bayonet was to do all—no
prisoners were to be secured—they were directed to press
on—bear down all resistance—and push directly for the point
of the mountain.</p>

<p>The French corps that had already commenced its march,
formed in squares of regiments outside the town, between the
roads of Medellin and Merida, with the cavalry on the left—and
Stewart’s brigade pressed forward through the streets,
leaving to a wing of the 50th, the task of securing such of the
enemy, as this sudden attack prevented from escaping with the
columns. Finding the French in square, the 71st lined the
fences, while the 92nd formed and opened its fire. The
cavalry (Spanish), joined by a few English hussars, charged
and routed the horsemen of Girard, just as Wilson’s Portuguese
brigade broke through the mist, and appeared on the
left and rear of this devoted band. The French cavalry
instantly galloped off; and the infantry threw down their
arms, and endeavoured to escape by the mountain. The paths
over the Sierra, difficult at all times, were now a wretched
route to retreat by,—the advanced British regiment was
already mixed with the rear of the fugitives—and a scrambling
pursuit succeeded. In a regular rout resistance is seldom
offered; and a number of prisoners, the arms, baggage—in
short, the whole <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of Girard’s division, were taken
by the victors with trifling loss.</p>

<p>After this successful expedition, Hill retired again to Portalegre;
the troops took up their old cantonments—and for a
time active operations terminated.</p>

<p>The success of the British arms had a very powerful effect
in rousing the spirits of the Spaniards, whose armies had
hitherto been so frequently and signally defeated. The irregular
bands of guerilla leaders everywhere increased—and their
activity and enterprise crippled the resources of the French,
and caused them much alarm and embarrassment. Although
generally unfortunate in the field, in desultory warfare the
Spanish partisans were formidable; and in the south it required
incessant vigilance on the part of the invaders, to secure their
detached posts, and move their convoys through the country.</p>

<p>One of those fortunate affairs—few and far between—that
shed a passing gleam of glory upon the Spanish arms, occurred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
at Vals, between Eugene and Sarsfield. The French were
completely beaten, and Eugene himself killed.</p>

<p>Other operations of no great moment were attended with
varied success. Suchet had succeeded Macdonald; and by
his activity the province of Catalonia was overrun, the Spanish
strongholds gradually wrested from their possession, and Tarragona
regularly besieged.</p>

<p>From the strength of the place, and the number of the garrison,
the city was obstinately held against the French. But
one after the other, its defences were carried by storm—and as
no quarter was given, scenes, too horrible for conception, were
enacted. The men were savagely butchered,—the women exposed
to the most dreadful indignities,—and in the annals of war,
among many instances of frightful excesses perpetrated by an
infuriated soldiery, those occurring at the storm of Tarragona<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
will be found the worst.</p>

<p>In the south of Spain, Ballasteros had been successful in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
some affairs with the French detachments; and the people of
Ronda, a mountain district of great strength, were up in arms.
In consequence, Godinot was despatched by Soult with a division
against Ballasteros, who was eventually driven to the extremity
of the Peninsula, and obliged to obtain protection under
the guns of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>A corps of British and Spanish troops had, in this interim,
been landed from Cadiz, and took possession of Tarifa, and
Godinot put his division in motion to attack them. His line
of march was by the coast—and some British vessels having
been apprised that he was advancing, had anchored close to
the pass of La Pena. On attempting to get forward, the ships
opened their batteries, and swept the road with such excellent
effect, that Godinot abandoned the route, and hastily retreated.</p>

<p>Soult, however, had determined that Tarifa should be reduced;
and Laval, with considerable reinforcements, was
directed to invest it without delay. Tarifa was a place of
little strength—an old slight wall, connecting a number of
towers, forming its whole protection. The town is traversed
by a mountain river, whose entrance is secured by a tower
and portcullis, while the bed of the stream was strongly palisaded.
The outlet was defended by an old castle and tower
called the Guzmans. Tarifa joins a promontory of small extent,
by a sandy spot of land and a causeway; and on the
highest sandhill, called Catalina, a field-work, armed with a
twelve-pounder, had been hastily thrown up. The presence
of a British line-of-battle ship and frigate in the bay secured
the island, and prevented any operations from being attempted
within the range of their powerful batteries.</p>

<p>On the 20th, the place was invested by Laval. The siege
commenced with an evil omen; for on the next morning a
French picket having incautiously advanced, was suddenly cut
off by a party of the 11th regiment, and captured.</p>

<p>A daring sally was made next day. Some of the English
garrison penetrated the French camp and seized a gun; of
course they were unable to carry it away, but they managed to
draw the enemy under the fire of the ships and tower, by
which they suffered considerably.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, Laval broke ground, and pushed forward his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
approaches by the eastern front until the 26th. On the 29th,
the French having received their siege artillery, the guns
opened on the wall, while their howitzers shelled the island.
A very few discharges shook the old and feeble masonry—and
in a few hours it came down in such masses, as formed an
enormous breach, and left the place equally open to assault or
escalade.</p>

<p>The street of Tarifa immediately behind the breach was
fourteen feet beneath its level. Every preparation was made
to receive the assault, the houses that commanded the breach
being fortified and garrisoned, the street effectually barricaded,
and the troops carefully distributed. To the 47th and Spaniards
the defence of the breach was entrusted—the 87th held
the portcullis, tower, and rampart; while a rifle company connected
the regiments with each other.</p>

<p>Although for sixty feet the breach was open, and offered
an easy ascent, the French did not venture to storm. At
night, salvos of grape were fired by the French batteries—but
in the intervals between the discharges, the garrison cleared
the foot of the breach, and enlarged their means of defence
behind it.</p>

<p>On the night of the 30th, a tremendous rain increased the
river to such a height, that the torrent, sweeping all before it,
broke down the palisades and injured the portcullis. But this
calamity did not daunt the British; they laboured vigorously
all night, and by morning the defences were restored.</p>

<p>The mountain flood subsided quickly, and at daylight, a
battalion of French grenadiers quietly approached by the river
bed, and rushed forward to break down the stockade. Not a
shot had been fired by the British, who waited their approach
with perfect coolness; but when they touched the portcullis,
a rolling volley was delivered with such terrible effect, that the
head of the column was annihilated, and all that composed it
perished, from the officer that led, to the poor drum-boy who
beat the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pas de charge</i>. The river bed was choked with
corpses—that approach was effectually barricaded by the dead,—while
rushing up the banks, the French grenadiers opened
their musketry, assisted by a fire from the trenches, and a
number of pits in front of their lines, which had been dug by
Laval to afford a cover for his sharpshooters. But the column<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
had been too much shattered by the first discharge to recover
its courage—a sustained fire of British musketry, closely and
efficiently kept up, cut off the boldest of the French soldiers
who still made any thing like an effort at advancing—while a
six-pounder on the town wall, enfiladed the assailants at
scarcely pistol distance, and kept up an unceasing torrent of
grape, that tore up the masses of the enemy, and drove them
once more for shelter to the hollow. It was hopeless to continue
longer under this murderous fire—and the French retired
at speed to their trenches, leaving the bed and banks of the
stream heaped with corpses; while the cheering of the garrison,
and the band of the 87th, as it struck up a national quickstep,
strangely contrasted with the groans of dying men, and the
still more harrowing outcries of the wounded.</p>

<p>Every kindness was bestowed upon these sufferers by their
generous enemy. Those who could be carried off the field
were brought through the breach and dressed by English surgeons,
or allowed to be removed to their own camp. The
weather became horrible—rain fell in torrents—the besiegers
and besieged were equally inconvenienced—and on the night of
the 4th, Laval having destroyed part of his artillery and buried
the remainder, retreated, and abandoned the siege. During
the time the French remained before Tarifa, their loss exceeded
a thousand men, while the British casualties did not reach
much above one hundred.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>The Spanish armies continued their operations, and generally
with indifferent success. Blake and the army of Murcia were
totally defeated by Soult at Lorca. The Spanish general
afterwards assumed the command of the troops in Valencia—and
Suchet entered that province in considerable force.</p>

<p>At Murviedro, the French marshal, attempting by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup
de main</i> to carry the place, was repulsed with considerable
loss; but, having brought up his siege artillery, he reduced the
castle of Oropesa, and renewed his efforts with additional means
and increased vigour. His first assault failed; and Blake advancing
to raise the siege, Suchet determined to offer battle—and
on the 24th the French and Spaniards made their dispositions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
and formed in each other’s front. Early on the 25th,
the latter advanced, and attacked their enemy. For a time
the Spanish wings drove back the French, gained ground on
either flank and carried an important height; but, unfortunately,
they had endangered their centre by a too great extension of
their line; and Suchet, bringing up his reserve, strengthened
his left wing, and burst upon Blake’s weak point with a fury
not to be resisted. The Spaniards were broken, their left wing
cut to pieces in detail; while the right, by a gallant effort, retreated
in good order by the Valencia road. The Spanish loss
was estimated at seven thousand <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>; and Murviedro
surrendered on the following day.</p>

<p>Blake, after his defeat, took a strong position under the walls
of Valencia, threw up field-works, destroyed some bridges,
and fortified the others; while Suchet established himself on
the left bank of the Guadalavia, and waited for the reinforcements
for which he had applied. On Christmas-day a strong
corps arrived from Catalonia, and strengthened the French
army by ten thousand men; and on the next morning Suchet
crossed the river, drove the Spanish left from their intrenchments,
and obliged Blake, with the remainder of his army, to
shut himself up in Valencia.</p>

<p>Overburthened by a population and troops amounting to one
hundred thousand souls, the city could not hold out long.
Blake unsuccessfully endeavoured to force Suchet’s line, but
was again driven into the town. A bombardment ensued; and
on the 8th of January, a capitulation took place; the Spanish
army becoming prisoners of war, and Valencia opening its
gates to the conqueror.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_25">SIEGE OF CIUDAD RODRIGO.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Lord Wellington makes secret preparations to besiege Ciudad Rodrigo.—Siege
commences.—City carried by assault—and given up to plunder.</p></blockquote>

<p>A campaign highly honourable to the British arms had ended,
and the rival armies had taken up cantonments for the winter
months, each covering an extensive range of country, for the
better obtaining of forage and supplies. Active operations
for a season were suspended—and officers, whose private concerns
or bad health required a temporary leave of absence, had
asked and received permission to revisit England. The
restoration of the works of Almeida, which the French had
half destroyed, occupied the leisure time of the British and
Portuguese artificers—while, for the ostensible purpose of
arming that fortress, siege stores and a battering train were
conveyed thither by water carriage—the Douro having been
rendered navigable by the English engineers for an extended
distance of forty miles.</p>

<p>But the arming of Almeida was but a feint—the reduction
of Ciudad Rodrigo was the real object of Lord Wellington,—and
with indefatigable zeal he applied himself to obtain the
means. A waggon train was organized—six hundred carts,
on an improved construction, were built; and while the
French marshal, supposing that the weakness of Lord Wellington
was a security against any act of aggression upon his
part, detached Montbrun to Valencia, and Dorsenne to the
Asturias and Montana, the English general was quietly preparing
to strike a sudden and unexpected blow, and completed
his necessary arrangements for investing Rodrigo the 6th of
January.</p>

<p>Considering the season of the year, and the nakedness of
the country for many miles around the threatened fortress, the
intended operation was bold to a degree. The horses had
scarcely any forage, and the men were literally destitute of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
bread or shelter. The new year came in inclemently—rain
fell in torrents—and though the investment was delayed two
days, the brigade (Mackinnon’s) that marched from Aldea de
Ponte, left nearly four hundred men behind, in a route of only
four-and-twenty miles, numbers of whom perished on the line
of march, or died subsequently from the fatigue they had
endured.</p>

<p>Ciudad Rodrigo stands on high ground, in the centre of an
extensive plain it domineers. The city is erected on the right
bank of the Agueda, which there branches into numerous
channels, and forms a number of small islands. The citadel
commands the town, and standing on an elevated mound is
difficult of access on every side. Since their late occupation,
the French had added considerably to the strength of the place.
The suburbs were secured against a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de main</i>, by fortifying
two convents on their flanks, and another nearly in the
centre. On the north side the ground rises in two places;
that furthest from the works is thirteen feet above the level
of the ramparts, from which it is distant six hundred yards.
The other, of lesser altitude, is scarcely two hundred paces.
On the former the enemy had erected a redoubt; it was protected
by a fortified convent called San Francisco, as well as
the artillery of the place, which commanded the approaches
from the hill.</p>

<p>The Agueda is fordable in several places, the best passage
being within pistol-shot of the walls. In winter, from the
sudden floodings of the river, these fords cannot be relied upon—and
a bridge of eighteen trestles, with a platform four
hundred feet long, was secretly constructed in the citadel of
Almeida and conveyed to Salices.</p>

<p>Four divisions were entrusted with the duties of the siege.
They took their turns in course—each for twenty-four hours
furnishing the requisite guards and working parties.</p>

<p>On the night of the 8th of January, the investment was
regularly commenced, and the redoubt on the upper Teson
stormed by three companies of the 52nd with trifling loss.
Ground was broken on its flank—and by the morning the
trench was four feet wide and three in depth. On the following
night the first parallel was opened; and the outlines of
three batteries, for eleven guns each, were traced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
The weather continued dreadfully inclement; and as it was
believed that Marmont would endeavour to raise the siege,
Wellington decided on rapid operations, and resolved to
attempt a storm even with the counterscarps entire. Both the
besiegers and the besieged were active in their operations.
On the night of the 13th, the convent of Santa Cruz was
taken; and on the 14th, while the division was coming to
relieve the working parties, the garrison made a sortie, overturned
the gabions in advance of the parallel, and would have
succeeded in spiking the guns, but for the spirited opposition
of a few workmen and engineers, who checked the attempt,
until the head of the division closing up obliged the French
to retire.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th, the batteries were nearly ready
for breaching, mounted with twenty-three 24-pounders and
two eighteens. At four o’clock in the afternoon their fire
commenced,—and a spectacle more strikingly magnificent, it
has rarely been the good fortune even of a British soldier to
witness.</p>

<p>“The evening chanced to be remarkably beautiful and still;
there was not a cloud in the sky, nor a breath of wind astir,
when suddenly the roar of artillery broke in upon its calmness,
and volumes of smoke rose slowly from the batteries. These
floating gently towards the town, soon enveloped the lower
part of the hill, and even the ramparts and bastions in a dense
veil; while the towers and summits lifting their heads over
the haze, showed like fairy buildings, or those unsubstantial
castles which are sometimes seen in the clouds on a summer’s
day. The flashes from the British guns, answered as they
were from the artillery in the front, and the roar of their
thunder reverberating among the remote mountains of the
Sierra de Francisca; these, with the rattle of the balls against
the walls, proved altogether a scene which, to be rightly understood,
must be experienced.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>That night the convent of San Francisco was escaladed by
a wing of the 40th,—and the French having abandoned the
suburbs, they were occupied by the besiegers.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 15th the batteries resumed their fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
and at sunset the walls of the main scarp and fausse braye<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
were visibly shaken.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Under cover of a fog on the 16th, the
second parallel was prolonged; but the front of the works was
so limited, and the fire of the enemy so concentrated and
correct, that it required immense time to throw up a battery.
The difficulty may be readily imagined, from the fact of the
French having discharged at the approaches, upwards of
twenty thousand shot and shells. Another battery of seven
guns was opened on the 18th. On the 19th, two breaches
were distinctly visible from the trenches, and on being carefully
reconnoitred, they were declared practicable. Lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>Wellington examined them in person,—decided on storming
them that evening,—and from behind the reverse of one of the
approaches, issued written orders for the assault.</p>

<p>The French were not inactive. The larger breach, exposing
a shattered front of more than one hundred feet, had been
carefully mined—the base of the wall strewn with shells and
grenades, and the top, where troops might escalade, similarly
defended. Behind, a deep retrenchment was cut to insulate
the broken rampart, in the event of its being carried by storm.
The lesser breach was narrow at the top, exceedingly steep,
with a four-and-twenty-pounder turned sideways, that blocked
the passage up, except an opening between the muzzle and the
wall, by which two files might enter.</p>

<p>Early in the evening, the third and light divisions were
moved from their cantonments. At six, the third moved to
the rear of the first parallel, two gun-shots from the main
breach,—while the light formed behind a convent, three hundred
yards in front of the smaller one. Darkness came on,—and
with it came the order to “Stand to arms.” With calm
determination, the soldiers of the third division heard their
commanding officer announce the main breach as the object of
attack; and every man prepared himself promptly for the
desperate struggle. Off went the packs,—the stocks were
unbuckled,—the cartouch box arranged to meet the hand more
readily,—flints were screwed home,—every one after his
individual fancy, fitting himself for action. The companies
were carefully told off—the sergeants called the rolls,—and
not a man was missing.</p>

<p>The town clock struck seven,—and its sonorous bell knelled
the fate of hundreds. Presently the forlorn hope formed
under the leading of the senior subaltern of the 88th, William
Mackie: and Picton and Mackinnon rode up and joined the
division. The former’s address to the Connaught Rangers
was brief, it was to “Spare powder, and trust entirely to cold
iron.” The word was given,—“Forward!” was repeated in
under tones,—the forlorn hope led the way,—the storming
party, carrying bags filled with dry grass, followed,—the
division in column succeeded,—all moved on in desperate
silence, and of the third division not a file hung back.</p>

<p>The fifth regiment joined from the right, and all pressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
forward to the breach. The bags, thrown into the ditch by
the sappers, reduced the depth one half; ladders were instantly
raised, the storming party mounted, and after a short
but severe struggle, the breach was won.</p>

<p>Before the storming party had entered the ditch, the shells
and combustibles had been prematurely exploded, occasioning
but trifling loss to the assailants. The French instantly
abandoned the breach, sprang the mines, and fell back behind
the retrenchment, from which, and from the neighbouring
houses, they maintained a murderous fire.</p>

<p>In the mean time the light division had stormed the lesser
breach. It was most gallantly carried; and the loss would
not have been severe, but for the accidental explosion of a
service magazine behind the traverse, by which several officers
and a number of men were destroyed. Directed by the heavy
fire at the main breach, part of the 43rd and 95th rushed
along the ramparts to assist their comrades of the third division;
and Pack’s brigade, having converted their feint upon
the southern face of the works into a real attack, entered the
“fausse braye,” and drove the French before them with the
bayonet. Thus threatened in their rear, the enemy abandoned
the retrenchment; and, still resisting, were driven from street
to street, until they flung down their arms, and asked and
received that quarter which the laws of war denied, and
the fury of an excited soldiery left them but little hope of
obtaining.</p>

<p>The town was won; but, alas! many of the best and bravest
had fallen. Craufurd<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> was mortally wounded in leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
the light division to the lesser breach; and Mackinnon<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
blown up, after having gained the ramparts of the great one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
During the siege, the allies lost three officers and seventy-seven
killed; twenty-four officers and five hundred men
wounded; while in the storm, six officers and one hundred
and forty men fell, and sixty officers and nearly five hundred
men were wounded. The French loss was severe; and the
commandant, General Barrie, with eighty officers and seventeen
hundred men, were taken prisoners. There were found
upon the works one hundred and nine pieces of artillery, a
battering train of forty-four guns, and an armoury and arsenal
filled with military stores.</p>

<p>Thus fell Rodrigo. On the evening of the 8th the first
ground was broken,—on that of the 19th the British colours
were flying on the ramparts. Massena, after a tedious bombardment,
took a full month to reduce it; Wellington carried
it by assault in eleven days. No wonder that Marmont, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
his despatch to Berthier, was puzzled to account for the rapid
reduction of a place, respecting whose present safety and ultimate
relief, he had previously forwarded the most encouraging
assurances.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>After all resistance had ceased, the usual scene of riot,
plunder, and confusion, which by prescriptive right the
stormers of a town enjoy, occurred. Every house was entered
and despoiled; the spirit stores were forced open; the
soldiery got desperately excited; and in the madness of their
intoxication, committed many acts of silly and wanton violence.
All plundered what they could—and in turn they were
robbed by their own companions. Brawls and bloodshed
resulted—and the same men who, shoulder to shoulder, had
won their way over the “imminent deadly breach,” fought
with demoniac ferocity for some disputed article of plunder.
At last, worn out by fatigue, and stupified with brandy, they
sank into brutal insensibility; and on the second day, with
few exceptions, rejoined their regiments; the assault and
sacking of Rodrigo appearing in their confused imaginations,
rather like some troubled dream than a desperate and blood-stained
reality.</p>

<p>On the second day, order was tolerably restored; stragglers
had returned to their regiments; the breaches were repaired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
the trenches filled in, and the place being once more perfectly
defensible, was given up by Lord Wellington to Castanos, the
captain-general of the province, who had been present at the
siege. Additional honours were deservedly conferred upon
the conqueror of Rodrigo. Wellington was created an English
earl and a Spanish duke—and a farther annuity of
2,000<i>l.</i> a year was voted by a grateful country, to support
the dignities she had so deservedly conferred.</p>

<p>But another and a bolder blow was yet to be struck.
Again the troops were put in motion, and the order was
obeyed with pleasure, all being too happy to quit a place
where every supply had been exhausted, and every object
recalled the loss of relatives and friends.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> Leaving a division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
of infantry on the Agueda, the remainder of the army moved
rapidly back upon the Tagus, and, crossing the river, headquarters
were established at Elvas, on the 11th. There
every preparation was completed for one of the boldest of
Lord Wellington’s attempts,—for on the 16th, a pontoon
bridge across the Guadiana was traversed by the light, third,
and fourth divisions—and Badajoz regularly invested.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_26">SIEGE OF BADAJOZ.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Siege of Badajoz.—The Castle assaulted, and carried by escalade.—Philippon
surrenders.—Town given up to the soldiery, and sacked.</p></blockquote>

<p>The secrecy and despatch with which Lord Wellington had
formed or collected all necessary <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> for besieging the
formidable place on whose reduction he had determined, was
astonishing. The heavy guns had been brought by sea from
Lisbon, transhipped into craft of easy draught of water, and
thus conveyed up the river until they reached the banks of
the Guadiana. Gabions and fascines<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> were prepared in the
surrounding woods—intrenching-tools provided—the pontoon
bridge brought up from Abrantez—and the battering train,
comprising sixteen 24 and twenty 18-pounders, with sixteen
24-pound howitzers, were forwarded from Almeida, and
parked upon the glacis of Elvas, in readiness for the opening
of the siege.</p>

<p>Though not entirely aware of the extent of these hostile
preparations, Philippon, the governor of Badajoz, had apprised
Marshal Soult that the fortress was threatened, and demanded
a supply of shells and gunpowder. This requisition, though
immediately complied with, was not obtained—for Sir Rowland
Hill, with his characteristic activity, prevented the convoy
from reaching its destination. Indeed nothing which could
secure the place had been forgotten or neglected by its governor.
The forts of San Christoval and Pardelaras had been
considerably strengthened and enlarged,—the former by a
lunette,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> magazine and bomb-proof, and the latter by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
general repair. Badajoz was provisioned for five weeks,—the
garrison was numerous and well appointed,—and, confident
in his own resources and skill, Philippon, after two
successful defences, resolutely prepared himself for a third—and
with a perfect conviction that, like the others, it, too,
would prove successful.</p>

<p>The force that invested the fortress on the 16th was
placed under the command of Marshal Beresford, and consisted
of the divisions of Barnard, Picton, and Colville. The
first, sixth, and seventh divisions, with the cavalry of La
Marchant and Slade, were placed in advance, at Larena,
Mafra, and Los Santos, to observe the movements of Soult;
while the second British division, and the Portuguese under
General Hamilton, with a cavalry brigade attached, occupied
Merida and Almendralajo, to prevent any junction between
Soult and Marmont, should the latter attempt to unite his
forces with those of the Duke of Dalmatia.</p>

<p>Badajoz is easily described. Round one portion of the
town, the rivulets Calamon and Rivellas sweep, and unite with
the Guadiana, which flows in the face of the works, and in
front of the heights of San Christoval. The castle stands
above the union of these rivers. The fortifications are exceedingly
strong—the bastions and curtains regular—while formidable
outworks, the forts of Pardelaras, Picarina, and San
Christoval, complete the exterior defences.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
A close <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i> at once convinced Lord Wellington
that the defences had been amazingly improved—and, as time
pressed, and the means of regular investment were but indifferent,
he determined that the bastion of La Trinidad, from its
unfinished counterguard,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> should be battered. To effect
this, the Picarina redoubt, forming nearly an angle with the
bastion, and the lunette of San Rocque, must necessarily be
carried.</p>

<p>The night of the 16th was bad enough to mask any daring
essay—and rain, darkness, and storm favoured the bold
attempt. Ground was accordingly broken—and though but
one hundred and seventy yards from the covered-way, the
working parties were neither heard nor molested. The
17th and 18th were similarly employed—but under a heavy
fire from the Picarina fort, and such of the guns upon
the works as could be turned by the garrison on the approaches.</p>

<p>The evening of the 18th, however, produced a very different
scene—for the enemy became assailant—and a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sortie</i> was
made with fifteen hundred men, accompanied by some forty
cavalry. To the works, this sudden assault occasioned but
little mischief. The gabions<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> were overturned, some intrenching
tools captured, and great confusion caused among the
working parties; but the French were speedily driven back,
after causing much alarm, and a loss of one hundred and fifty
in killed and wounded. Colonel Fletcher, the chief of the
engineers, was unfortunately among the latter.</p>

<p>The weather was in every way unfavourable for prosecuting
the siege, and elemental influences seemed to have united with
Philippon against the allied commander. The rain fell in
torrents—the river rose far beyond its customary height,—the
pontoons swamped at their moorings—and all were swept
away. From the violence of the current, the flying bridges
worked but slowly, and serious apprehensions were entertained
lest the communications should be interrupted with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
other side, and, of necessity, that the siege must be raised.
To forward the works required incredible fatigue; the ground
was soaked with moisture; the trenches more than knee-deep
with mud and rain; the revêtements<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> of the batteries crumbled
away under any pressure, and it was almost impossible to lay
platforms for the guns. Indeed, had the works been ready
for their reception, the task of transporting heavy artillery
across a surface, rendered a perfect swamp by the incessant
torrents which had fallen for days without any intermission,
would have been a most laborious duty. Fortunately, the
weather changed, the ground dried partially, and the works
were carried on with additional spirit. By employing teams
of oxen, assisted by numerous fatigue parties, the guns were
brought forward, and the batteries armed—and on the 25th
they opened on the Picarina and the place itself, with excellent
effect, while Philippon returned the fire from every gun
upon the ramparts that could be brought to bear.</p>

<p>Perceiving the true object of the besiegers, and certain that
the Picarina would be assailed, ample measures were taken
for its defence. The ditch was deepened, the gorge secured
by an additional palisade; under the angles of the glacis
fougasses<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> were placed, and shells and grenades laid along the
parapet, to roll down upon the storming party at the moment
of attack. The ditch was exposed to a flanking fire, and two
hundred spare muskets were ranged along the banquet. Every
means, in short, were adopted that could insure a vigorous
and successful resistance.</p>

<p>That night, at ten o’clock, the fort was attacked and carried
by five hundred men of the third division, under Major-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>general
Kempt. One party was directed to attempt the
gorge, another prevented the place from being succoured from
the city, and at the same time cut off the garrison from
retreat; and a third were to distract the attention of the
French, and assist their comrades by making a front attack.</p>

<p>The first detachment reached the gorge undiscovered, but
failed in forcing the palisades, from the heavy fire of musketry
poured on them by the garrison. Retiring from a place
where success was hopeless, the storming party moved round
the left flank, and escaladed and won the parapet; while
another forced the salient angle simultaneously. The French
retreated to a guard-house, which they barricaded and defended
most obstinately. Alarmed by a false report that a
large body of the besieged had sallied from the town to relieve
the fort, the troops were about to abandon these advantages,
and quit a place their bravery had already won; but General
Kempt dispelled the panic, led them forward, and attacked
the garrison again, who fought to the very last; and, with
the exception of some seventy, perished while desperately
resisting. The taking of Picarina was gallantly effected, but
it cost the British dear—the casualties, in killed and wounded,
being nineteen officers and upwards of three hundred men.</p>

<p>The capture of the fort enabled the second parallel to be
pushed on, and breaching batteries to be completed. The
guns maintained a heavy fire on the bastion of La Trinidad;
and the sappers directed their efforts against the lunette of
San Rocque. The progress of the siege was slow; and
though two breaches were made, the certainty that both were
retrenched<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> and secured by interior defences, rendered an
assault too hazardous an experiment to be ventured. Lord
Wellington was critically circumstanced; Marmont had made
some forward movements in front of Beira—and Soult was
advancing, determined to relieve the place. His light troops
were already at Larena; the covering army under Hill had
been obliged to retreat; and after blowing up two arches of
the bridge of Merida, had taken post in front of Talavera.
In consequence, the fifth division was ordered to advance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
leaving the observation of San Christoval to the Portuguese
cavalry; the British general having decided on leaving a
corps of ten thousand men to protect the trenches, and with
the remainder of his force bring Soult to action.</p>

<p>At noon, on the 5th, the breaches were reconnoitred and
declared practicable; but the assault was deferred for another
day to allow the artillery time to batter down the curtain,
connecting the bastion with an unfinished ravelin. The concentrated
fire of the British batteries fell upon the old wall
with irresistible force; it was breached in a single day, and
thus three points for assault were thrown open. The report
of the engineers was encouraging; the main breach was sufficiently
wide, and the ascent to all three easy enough for
troops to mount.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock on the night of the 6th was appointed for the
assault to be attempted, and the necessary orders were issued
accordingly. The castle was to be attacked by the third division—the
bastion of La Trinidad by the fourth—that of Santa
Maria by the light division—the lunette of San Rocque by a
party from the trenches; while the fifth should distract the
garrison by a false attack on the Pardelaras, and the works
contiguous to San Vicente.</p>

<p>Philippon, well aware that an assault might be expected,
had employed every resource that skill and ingenuity could
devise to render the attempt a failure. As Lord Wellington
had neither time nor means to destroy the counterscarps, the
French were enabled to raise the most formidable obstructions
at their foot, and insulate the breaches effectually. At night,
the rubbish was removed, retrenchments formed, and the battered
parapets repaired by sand-bags, casks, and woolpacks.
Powder-barrels and grenades were laid along the trenches—and
at the foot of the breach sixty fourteen-inch shells, communicating
with hoses and bedded in earth, were placed
ready for explosion. A chevaux-de-frieze<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> was stretched
across the rampart, and planks studded with spikes covered
the slopes of the breaches. Every species of combustible was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
employed, and a cartridge specially prepared for the musketry,
formed of buck-shot and slugs; and when the distance was so
close, nothing would prove more mischievous.</p>

<p>The day was remarkably fine—and the troops, in high spirits,
heard the orders for the assault, and proceeded to clean
their appointments, as if a dress parade only was intended.
Evening came,—darkness shut distant objects out,—the regiments
formed,—the roll was called in an under-voice,—the
forlorn hope stepped out,—the storming party was told off,—all
were in readiness, and “eager for the fray.”</p>

<p>Shortly before ten, a beautiful firework rose from the
town, and shewed the outline of Badajoz and every object
that lay within several hundred yards of the works. The
flame of the carcase died gradually away—and darkness,
apparently more dense, succeeded this short and brilliant illumination.</p>

<p>The word was given, the forlorn hope moved forward, the
storming parties succeeded, and the divisions, in columns, closed
the whole. Of these splendid troops, now all life and daring,
how many were living in an hour?</p>

<p>At that moment the deep bell of the cathedral of St. John
struck ten; the most perfect silence reigned around, and
except the softened footsteps of the storming parties, as they
fell upon the turf with military precision, not a movement was
audible. A terrible suspense,—a horrible stillness,—darkness,—a
compression of the breathing,—the dull and ill-defined
outline of the town,—the knowledge that similar and
simultaneous movements were making on other points,—the
certainty that two or three minutes would probably involve
the forlorn hope in ruin, or make it the beacon-light to conquest,—all
these made the heart throb quicker, and long for
the bursting of the storm, when victory should crown daring
with success, or hope and life should end together.</p>

<p>On went the storming parties—one solitary musket was
discharged beside the breach—but none answered it. The
light division moved forward, rapidly closing up in columns
at quarter distance. The ditch was gained,—the ladders
were lowered,—on rushed the forlorn hope, with the storming
party close behind them. The divisions were now on the
brink of the sheer descent, when a gun boomed from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
parapet. The earth trembled,—a mine was fired,—an explosion,—and
an infernal hissing from lighted fusees succeeded,—and,
like the rising of a curtain on the stage, in the hellish
glare that suddenly burst out around the breaches, the French
lining the ramparts in crowds, and the English descending the
ditch, were placed as distinctly visible to each other as if the
hour were noontide!</p>

<p>A tremendous fire from the guns, a number of which had
been laid upon the approaches to the breach, followed the explosion;
but, all undaunted, the storming party cheered—and
undauntedly the French answered it. A murderous scene
ensued, for the breach was utterly impassable. Notwithstanding
the withering fire of musketry from the parapets, with
light artillery directed immediately on the breach, and grape
from every gun upon the works that could play upon the assailants
and the supporting columns, the British mounted.
Hundreds were thrown back, and hundreds as promptly succeeded
them. Almost unharmed themselves, the French
dealt death around; and secure within defences, that even in
daylight and to a force unopposed, proved afterwards nearly
insurmountable, they ridiculed the mad attempt; and while
they viewed from the parapets a thousand victims writhing in
the ditch, they called in derision to the broken columns, and
invited them to come on.</p>

<p>While the assaults upon the breaches were thus fatally unsuccessful,
the third and fifth divisions had moved to their
respective points of attack. Picton’s, to whom the citadel was
assigned, found difficulties nearly equal to those encountered
at the breaches. Thither Philippon had determined to retire,
if the assault upon the other defences should succeed, and, in
that event, hold the castle and San Christoval to the last. To
render the place more secure, he had caused the gates to be
built up, and the ramparts were lined with shells, cart-wheels,
stones, and every destructive missile. Fireballs betrayed
the movements of the assailants; and, for a time, every attempt
at escalade failed with prodigious loss. At last one
ladder was planted,—a few daring spirits gained the ramparts,—crowds
followed them,—and in an incredibly short time the
castle was won. Philippon heard of the disaster too late to
redeem its loss. The troops despatched from the breaches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
elsewhere were unable to recover it,—a British jacket waved
from the flag-staff, and in the first dawn of morning announced
the downfal of Badajoz.</p>

<p>The fifth division were equally successful; though General
Leith had to delay his attack till eleven o’clock, from the party
who had charge of the ladders losing their way.</p>

<p>The attempt on San Vicente succeeded, notwithstanding
every preparation had been made for its defence; Major-general
Walker overcame all opposition, and established himself
securely in the place.</p>

<p>“And yet it is astonishing, even in the spring-tide of success,
how the most trivial circumstances will damp the courage
of the bravest, and check the most desperate in their career.
The storming party of the fifth had escaladed a wall of thirty
feet with wretched ladders, forced an uninjured palisade,
descended a deep counterscarp, crossed the lunette behind it,
and this was effected under a converging fire from the bastions,
and a well-sustained fusilade, while but a few of the
assailants could force their way together, and form on the
rampart when they got up. But the leading sections persevered
until the brigade was completely lodged within the parapet;
and now united, and supported by the division who followed
fast, what could withstand their advance?</p>

<p>“They were sweeping forward with the bayonet,—the
French were broken and dispersed—when at this moment of
brilliant success, a port-fire, which a retreating gunner had
flung upon the rampart, was casually discovered. A vague
alarm seized the leading files—they fancied some mischief was
intended,—and imagined the success, which their own desperate
gallantry had achieved, was but a <em>ruse</em> of the enemy to
lure them to destruction. ‘It is a mine,—and they are
springing it!’ shouted a soldier. Instantly the leaders of the
storming party turned—and it was impossible for their officers
to undeceive them. The French perceived the panic,—rallied
and pursued,—and friends and foes came rushing back tumultuously
upon a supporting regiment (the 38th) that was fortunately
formed in reserve upon the ramparts. This momentary
success of the besieged was dearly purchased; a volley was
thrown closely in, a bayonet rush succeeded, and the French
were scattered before the fresh assailants, never to form again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
The fifth division rushed on; every thing gave way that opposed
it—the cheering arose above the firing—the bugles
sounded an advance,—the enemy became distracted and disheartened—and
again the light and fourth divisions,—or, alas!
their skeletons, assisted by Hay’s brigade, advanced to the
breaches. No opposition was made; they entered, and Badajoz
was their own! Philippon, finding that all was lost,
retired across the river to San Christoval; and early next day,
surrendered unconditionally.”</p>

<p>The loss sustained by the allies in the reduction of this well-defended
fortress was awful. In the assault alone, the British
casualties were fifty-nine officers and seven hundred and forty-four
men killed. Two hundred and fifty-eight officers, and
two thousand six hundred men wounded!</p>

<p>Lord Wellington had stationed himself on the high ground
behind San Christoval, to view the progress of the assault.
During a contest so doubtful and protracted, his anxiety was
painfully acute. What a period of dreadful suspense must
have ensued, from the time the striking of the town clock announced
the marching of the divisions, until the thunder of
artillery told the British leader that the conflict had begun!
For a minute, the fireworks thrown from the place, showed
the columns at the breaches. Darkness followed—stillness
more horrible yet—and then the sudden burst of light, as shells
and mines exploded. The main breach was literally in a
blaze—sheets of fire mounted to the sky, accompanied by a
continued roaring of hellish noises, as every villanous combustible
was ignited to discover or destroy the assailants.</p>

<p>The wounded came fast to the rear, but they could tell little
how matters were progressing. At last a mounted officer rode
up. He was the bearer of evil tidings—the attack upon the
breaches had failed—the majority of the officers had fallen—the
men, left without leaders to direct them, were straggling
about the ditch, and unless instant assistance was sent, the
assault must fail entirely. Pale but collected, the British
general heard the disastrous communication, and issued orders
to send forward a fresh brigade (Hay’s) to the breaches. Half
an hour passed, and another officer appeared. He came from
Picton to say the castle had been escaladed, and that the
third division was actually in the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Instantly staff officers were despatched to the castle with
orders that it should be retained, and that the divisions, or
rather their relics, should be withdrawn from the breaches.</p>

<p>Though the regular assaults had been sanguinary failures,
the detached attacks upon the castle and San Vincente were
brilliantly successful, and either of them must have next day
produced the fall of Badajoz. In fact, the city was doubly
won; and had Leith’s division obtained their ladders in proper
order, the place would have fallen in half the time, and a
frightful loss of life have been consequently avoided.</p>

<p>It may be readily imagined that such a fierce resistance as
that made by the French would provoke a desperate retaliation
from the victors; and as the city was given up to the
excited soldiery, for a day and two nights it presented a fearful
scene of rapine and riot. The streets were heaped with the
drunken and the dead—and very many of the conquerors,
who had escaped uninjured in the storm, fell by the bayonets
of their comrades.</p>

<p>No language can depict the horrors which succeed a storm;
and the following vivid but faithful picture of Badajoz, as it
appeared on the evening after it had been carried, will convey
some idea of the dreadful outrages that ensued.</p>

<p>“It was nearly dusk, and the few hours while I slept had
made a frightful change in the condition and temper of the
soldiery. In the morning they were obedient to their officers,
and preserved the semblance of subordination; now they were
in a state of furious intoxication—discipline was forgotten—and
the splendid troops of yesterday had become a fierce and
sanguinary rabble, dead to every touch of human feeling, and
filled with every demoniac passion that can brutalize the man.
The town was in terrible confusion, and on every side frightful
tokens of military license met the eye.</p>

<p>“One street, as I approached the castle, was almost choked
up with broken furniture; for the houses had been gutted
from the cellar to the garret, the partitions torn down, and
even the beds ripped and scattered to the winds, in the hope
that gold might be found concealed. A convent<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> at the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
of the strada of Saint John was in flames; and I saw more
than one wretched nun in the arms of a drunken soldier.</p>

<p>“Farther on, the confusion seemed greater. Brandy and
wine casks were rolled out before the stores; some were full,
some half drunk, but more staved in mere wantonness, and the
liquors running through the kennel. Many a harrowing
scream saluted the ear of the passer-by; many a female supplication
was heard asking in vain for mercy. How could it
be otherwise, when it is remembered that twenty thousand
furious and licentious madmen were loosed upon an immense
population, among which many of the loveliest women upon
earth might be found? All within that devoted city was at
the disposal of an infuriated army, over whom for the time
control was lost, aided by an infamous collection of camp followers,
who were, if possible, more sanguinary and pitiless
even than those who had survived the storm!</p>

<p>“It is useless to dwell upon a scene from which the heart
revolts. Few females in this beautiful town were saved that
night from insult. The noblest and the beggar—the nun, and
the wife and daughter of the artisan—youth and age, all were
involved in general ruin. None were respected, and few consequently
escaped. The madness of those desperate brigands
was variously exhibited; some fired through doors and windows;
others at the church-bells; many at the wretched
inhabitants as they fled into the streets to escape the bayonets
of the savages who were demolishing their property within
doors; while some wretches, as if blood had not flowed in
sufficient torrents already, shot from the windows their own
companions as they staggered on below. What chances had
the miserable inhabitants of escaping death when more than
one officer perished by the bullets and bayonets of the very
men whom a few hours before he had led to the assault?”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>Strict measures were taken on the second day by Lord
Wellington to repress these desperate excesses,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> and save the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
infuriated soldiery from the fatal consequences their own
debauchery produced;<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> a Portuguese brigade was brought
from the rear, and sent into the town, accompanied by the
provost marshal and the gallows. This demonstration had its
due effect, and one rope carried terror to rioters, whom the
bayonets of a whole regiment could not appal.</p>

<h2 id="chap_27">RETREAT OF THE FRENCH.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Soult retreats.—Cavalry affair at Usagre.—Marmont invades Portugal.—Affair
with the militias.—Retires into Spain.—Surprise and destruction
of the works and bridge at Almarez.—Failure of Ballasteros at Bornos.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marshal Soult had come up within two marches of Badajoz
before he was apprised that the city had been carried by assault.
Nothing could exceed his astonishment,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> for he had
been perfectly assured that the fortress was in no immediate
danger; and he felt confident with Marmont’s assistance, by
attacking the covering army, to save Badajoz from falling.
On ascertaining the disastrous issue of the siege, the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
marshal instantly retreated, and the British cavalry actively
pursued him.</p>

<p>At Usagre, by a rapid night-march of Anson’s and Le Marchant’s
brigades, Sir Stapleton Cotton overtook Soult’s rear-guard,
under the command of Peyreymont. The French
having only observed Ponsonby, who led the advance, supposed
that he was unsupported, and formed on a rising ground
behind the Benvenida road. For a time, the English general
delayed them by skirmishing, while Le Marchant, concealed
by the heights, was getting quickly in their rear. This
effected, Ponsonby charged boldly in front, while the fifth
dragoon guards galloped round the hill, and unexpectedly
threw themselves upon their flank. The French broke, and
retired in great disorder, followed by the English cavalry, who
for several miles pursued the flying enemy, cutting down numbers,
and securing one hundred and thirty prisoners. The
affair was a very gallant one,—and the more creditable to the
victor, as the force on each side was nearly equal.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>Marmont, on his advance from Salamanca, after blockading
Ciudad Rodrigo and investing Almeida, had pushed forward
into Portugal, driving the militia back. Their leaders, Trant
and Wilson, expecting assistance from Silviera, took a position
at Guarda, to protect the magazines at Celerico; while the
French marauding parties overran the lower Beira, wasting
and plundering the country, and treating the peasantry with
shameful cruelty. Unable from his weakness, to hold Castello
Branco longer, Le Cor, after removing the hospitals and destroying
the magazines, fell back to Sarnadas.</p>

<p>Trant had formed the bold design of surprising Marmont at
Sabugal, but was in turn surprised himself. His outposts
were cut off, and the French were almost entering the streets,
when accident alarmed the marshal, and prevented him from
profiting by the earlier success of his night-march over the
mountain.</p>

<p>Trant fell back on the Mondego, and for a time the battalions
retired in good order; but the rear-guard, on being
pressed by Marmont’s cavalry, gave way and abandoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
their arms and colours, endeavoured to cross the river.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> Some
were cut down, but many more were drowned in their ignominious
attempt to escape; and to the humanity of the French
marshal the greater portion of the fugitives owed their safety—as
Marmont discontinued the pursuit and arrested the work
of slaughter.</p>

<p>Wilson remained in charge of the magazines at Celerico,
until the French had advanced close to the place, and driven
in his outposts. The Portuguese general then issued orders
to destroy the stores; fortunately, they were but partially
obeyed, for Marmont immediately retired, left Guarda to the
militia, and consequently a part of the magazines was saved.</p>

<p>Finding that his indefatigable opponent was marching
northwards, Marmont fell farther back on Sabugal, and after
raising the blockade of Rodrigo, again retreated on Salamanca.</p>

<p>The allied army immediately took up cantonments on the
Coa and Agueda; and as an ample commissariat had been
established behind the Douro, the troops were abundantly
supplied.</p>

<p>The head-quarters were removed to Fuente Guinaldo, and
Lord Wellington determined to re-establish his own communications
across the Tagus,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> and destroy those of the enemy.
Both designs were accomplished with his usual success; and,
as military operations, the science displayed in the execution
of the one, was only equalled by the boldness that marked the
daring manner with which the other was effected.</p>

<p>To interrupt the communications of the French marshals, to
whom he was about to oppose himself, was an object of paramount
importance, and it was determined that an attempt
should be made upon the pontoons and works at Almarez, it
being the only passage practicable to an army, since the permanent
bridges on the Tagus, from Arzobispo downwards, had
been blown up. The French, aware of the value of this important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
passage, adopted every means within their power to
protect it from being surprised, or assaulted with success.
Both banks of the river were jealously fortified—the left of
the Tagus being protected by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-du-pont</i><a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> regularly intrenched
and flanked, and commanded by Fort Napoleon—a
strong redoubt placed on the high ground above the bridge.
The fort was secured by an interior intrenchment, with a loopholed
tower in the centre armed with nine pieces of cannon,
and a garrison of four hundred men. Fort Ragusa, similar in
strength and construction, commanded the right bank: it
flanked the bridge with which it was connected by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">flêche</i>.
At a league’s distance, a pass for carriages, called the Puerto
de Miravete, winds through a steep sierra, and opens on an
expanse of barren country entirely overrun with the gum-cistus.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
There an old castle, standing on the crest of the
heights, was fortified and surrounded by an enciente twelve
feet high. The large venta on the road side was formed into
a place of defence—and with the two smaller works that
connected it with the castle on the brow of the hill, altogether
formed a line of very considerable strength.</p>

<p>To destroy the bridge and works was a task intrusted to
Sir Rowland Hill; and on the 12th of May, he moved from
Almandralejo, with part of the second division and six
24-pound howitzers. He reached Jaraicejo early on the 16th,
within eight miles of the summit of the pass—and there
dividing his force into three columns, to each a separate duty
was assigned. The left brigade under General Chowne, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
directed to escalade the castle of Miravete, and for this purpose
were provided with ropes and ladders. The centre, under
General Long, with the howitzers, marched by the great road
to attack the Puerto; while by a devious and rugged footway,
Sir Rowland himself moved by Romangordo, to carry
the bridge-works upon the right. The columns moved the
same evening, but owing to the difficulties of the ground they
could not reach their intended points of attack before daybreak.
Sir Rowland, therefore, deferred the attempt until he
should personally examine the works, and the troops bivouacked
on the sierra.</p>

<p>It proved that the castle, from its peculiar position, would
require time to secure its reduction—and the least delay must
prove fatal to success. General Chowne was therefore ordered
to make a false attack with the left brigade, while the
right, under General Howard, should steal down the broken
side of the sierra, and attempt Fort Napoleon by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de
main</i>.</p>

<p>The plan, notwithstanding that many unexpected obstacles
delayed the columns of attack, succeeded. The French, never
supposing that the bridge would be attempted until the pass
was first carried, and a passage opened for the guns, were
astounded soon after daybreak, on seeing the 50th and a wing
of the 71st rush from the cover of a hill, and commence an
escalade in three different places. After a sharp resistance,
they abandoned the fort, and rushing through the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-du-pont</i>,
retreated over the bridge to find shelter, as they hoped, in
Fort Ragusa. But the coward who commanded there, panic-struck,
had already destroyed the communication; and in a
vain attempt to avoid the bayonets of their assailants who
followed them pell-mell, many perished in the Tagus, and the
remainder, amounting to two hundred and fifty, including the
governor, were made prisoners. Fort Ragusa was abandoned
by the commandant, and the redoubt, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-du-pont</i>, pontoons,
and carriages, with an immense quantity of stores, were
destroyed, the victors in this brilliant affair having sustained
but a very inconsiderable loss. The commandant of Fort
Ragusa retreated to Navalmoral. There he was placed under
arrest—tried by a court-martial, and shot at Talavera, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
fate the cowardly desertion of his own comrades so richly
merited.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>Sir Rowland retired without molestation by the Truxillo
road, and took up his former quarters at Merida. Too late,
the intelligence of his march had reached the French marshals—and
though both took instant measures to save the bridge
and intercept the expedition, their efforts were unavailing.
Marmont reached the Tagus “too late to prevent the evil, and
without the means of repairing it;” and Soult, finding that the
British rear-guard had already passed Truxillo, gave up the
hope of overtaking it, and retired to Seville.</p>

<p>A less fortunate attempt by Ballasteros, was made on the
French works on the line of the Guadalete. A division of
the army of Andalusia, of four thousand five hundred men,
under General Corvoux, having occupied Bornos, the Spanish
general assembled a force of six thousand at Majada de Ruiz
over night, and crossed the Guadalete unnoticed. But, notwithstanding
a surprise, the French easily repulsed the attack;
and Ballasteros was driven across the river in confusion, and
with the loss of a fourth of his entire force.</p>

<p>Nothing can prove the miserable inefficiency of the Spanish
troops more strongly, than the result of this wretched attempt
on Bornos. Every circumstance favoured it: in force they
were stronger by a fourth; and yet an enemy inferior in
number, and taken by surprise, not only routed their
assailants, but would have literally destroyed them, had not the
friendly waters of the Guadalete covered their ignominious
flight.</p>

<p>Early in June, the British divisions began to concentrate;
and on the 13th, the cantonments on the Agueda were broken
up, and Lord Wellington crossed the frontier.</p>

<p>The condition of the army was excellent, and the most
exact discipline was preserved, while all unnecessary parades
were dispensed with. The march ended, the soldier enjoyed
all the comforts he could command—if foot-sore, he had rest
to recruit; if untired, he had permission to amuse himself.
His arms and appointments were rigidly inspected, his supper
cooked, his bivouac formed,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> and at sunrise he rose at the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reveille</i>, to resume, with light heart and “gallant hope,” the
march that was to lead to victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
The weather was fine—and as the route lay principally
through forest lands, nothing could be more picturesque and
beautiful than the country which the line of march presented.
The wooded landscape displayed its verdure under the sunny
influence of a cloudless sky, and singularly contrasted its summer
green with the snow-topped pinnacles of the Sierra de
Gata. No enemy appeared—for days the march was leisurely
continued—until, on clearing the forest at Valmasa, the German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Hussars in advance, had a slight skirmish with a French
picket in front of Salamanca.</p>

<p>This city, celebrated for its antiquity, and noted in the middle
ages as foremost among the most celebrated schools of
learning, was destined to witness a fresh triumph of British
bravery. The situation of Salamanca is bold and imposing,
standing on high ground on the right bank of the Tormes,
and surrounded by a fine champaign country, divested of wood,
but interspersed with numerous clay-built villages. A Roman
road can still be traced without the town—while a portion of
the bridge across the Tormes, consisting of twenty-seven
arches, is supposed to have been constructed when the Eternal
City was mistress of the world.</p>

<p>The Duke of Ragusa, aware of the advance of the allies,
collected all his disposable force, and occupied the heights
south of the river; but during the night he evacuated the
city—leaving the forts he had constructed, amply stored with
provisions and ammunition, and garrisoned by eight hundred
men.</p>

<p>Early next morning, the light brigade advanced, and cautiously
felt its way through the villages which were found to be
unoccupied. The whole army approached the city by brigades,
and passing in open column of companies, the divisions moved
barely out of cannon-shot of the fort, and directed their march
on the fords of Santa Martha and El Campo, while the French
stood upon the ramparts of San Vicente, looking with marked
interest on the allied masses as they defiled across the plain.</p>

<p>The sixth division took possession of the city, while the
others bivouacked in its immediate vicinity—and nothing
could surpass the delight of the inhabitants, when they found
themselves liberated from a bondage which they had endured
for three long years. The men shouted their vivas,—the
women caressed their deliverers,—while in the evening, music
and dancing marked the general joy; and the illuminated
streets might have been seen at the distance of many leagues.</p>

<p>But it was only for a brief time that the advance of the
allies was interrupted. The convent of San Vicente, placed
on a perpendicular cliff rising from the bed of the Tormes, had
been fortified by Marmont with admirable skill. It was connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
at either side with the old wall by a line of works, its
windows built up and crenellated, and the re-entering angle
secured by a fascine battery, palisaded in front, and defended
by a loop-holed wall. A steep descent towards the bridge was
separated from the opposite high grounds by a small rivulet
that joined the Tormes—while the convents of La Merced and
Cayetano, on the farther bank of the stream, were converted
into strong redoubts, and ditched, escarped, and casemated.
No pains had been spared by the French engineers to render
these works respectable. The inhabitants had been obliged to
lend their unwilling assistance; while, from the ruins of thirteen
convents, and two-and-twenty colleges, the best materials
for gates, palisades, and drawbridges, had been obtained. A
place so capable of defence, could not be left occupied by a
hostile garrison in the rear of an advancing army. It must
of necessity be reduced—and on the night of the 17th, the
sixth division broke ground, and in full moonlight commenced
erecting a breaching battery.</p>

<p>Unforseen obstacles in warfare will frequently render the
best-devised plans abortive. The vigilance of a dog saved the
counterscarp of San Vicente from being blown up, and the
miners failed, after suffering a heavy loss from a plunging fire,
from which they could not protect themselves. Carcasses were
tried without effect. The guns, four long eighteens, and four
24-pound howitzers, breached slowly, and it was the third
morning before the lower wall of the convent was blown down.
Its sudden fall brought the roof along with it, and a number
of the defenders, then firing through the loop-holes, were
buried in the ruins.</p>

<p>Marmont, who had retired from Salamanca with great reluctance,
was actively engaged, in the mean time, in collecting
reinforcements to enable him to recover the position he had
abandoned. Breaking up from Fuente Sabrico he advanced
with sixty thousand men, determined to offer battle. A sustained
cannonade along his line of march apprized the besieged
garrisons that succour was approaching, and Lord Wellington
made the necessary dispositions for a battle. The allied army
were drawn up upon the heights; the left resting on a chapel
and ravine,—the centre occupying the village of San Christolat,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
the right formed on a high ground in front of
Castellanos de los Moriscos. The advanced posts retired, and
a smart cannonade was maintained by the batteries on both
sides—and although both were ready for a battle, neither
would give a chance away. Several well-executed manœuvres
in front of the British position producing no important
result, Marmont fell back upon the flat grounds beside the
village of Villares, his right upon the road to Toro, and his
left in Castellanos.</p>

<p>Morning broke, and found the allies under arms. That day
some reinforcements reached the French, but Marmont would
not venture to attack. Wellington remained on the defensive,
and the rival armies bivouacked quietly in each other’s presence.
The weather was sultry; the heights unsheltered by
a single tree; and as both wood and water were of necessity
brought from Salamanca, the allies had but an indifferent supply
of either. The French were better off; their bivouacs
embraced several villages in the plain, the roofs and woodwork
of the houses yielding materials for their watchfires, while the
wells afforded a sufficiency of water,—an immense advantage
indeed to an army when operating beneath an ardent sun.</p>

<p>Another day passed; but during the night Marmont seized
an eminence on the right flank of the allied line, and occupied
it in some strength, and it was deemed necessary to dislodge
him. The 58th and 61st were ordered to attack the height:
it was carried in fine style, and no attempt was made by the
French marshal to retake it.</p>

<p>On the following evening, Marmont changed his position,
and endeavoured to communicate with the garrisons of San
Vicente and the redoubts. His right now occupied the heights
at Cabeza Vellosa, his left rested on the Tormes at Huerta, and
his centre in Aldea Rubia. A correspondent movement was
made by Lord Wellington. His right was extended to San
Martha, his advance to Aldea Lingua, and the heavy cavalry
were detached across the river to check any attempt upon the
fords.</p>

<p>The weather continued warm and dry, and as the whole
surface of the position was covered with ripe corn, it supplied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
in ample quantity forage for the horses and beds to the soldiery.
The country was unwooded, and the only shelter from
an ardent sun was obtained by stretching blankets over sticks,
and securing the edges to the ground. For this simple
luxury, Lord Wellington was indebted to a private of the
43rd, as his own accommodation was on a par with the humblest
soldier. From break of day he occupied a height in the centre
of the position, watching the movements of the French; his
staff, from time to time, visiting him for orders. His meals
were plainly served and rapidly despatched—and when night
came, wrapped in his cloak, “the earth his bed, the sky his
canopy,” he slept on the same sward upon which his splendid
divisions were reposing.</p>

<p>While the allied forces remained in position on the heights,
the 6th division pressed the siege of San Vicente and the dependent
forts, as vigorously as their very limited means of
aggression would permit. The breaching battery erected
against Cayetano having destroyed the palisades and injured
the parapet, General Bowes, considering that an assault might
succeed, attempted to carry it by escalade. Under a tremendous
fire two ladders were reared against the wall; but
the foremost of the assailants were shot, and the storming
party were repulsed with the loss of their gallant leader, and
one hundred and twenty killed and wounded. As the attack
was made at sunset, the increased firing was distinctly heard
by both armies. Gradually it slackened,—at length nearly
died away,—and three rockets, thrown up from the fort, apprized
Marmont that the assault had failed. The signal was
answered by several rounds of artillery from the French position
on the right. The musketry than ceased totally, and the
remainder of the night passed undisturbed.</p>

<p>The morning of the 24th was obscured by a dense fog;—a
brisk firing was heard beyond the river, but it was impossible
to ascertain, from the thickness of the atmosphere, in what
numbers the French movement was being made. At last the
sun broke out, and Bock’s heavy dragoons were seen retiring
before a division which Marmont had thrown across the
Tormes before daylight. Directly, the 1st and 7th divisions
were sent to support the cavalry. The French hesitated to
attack,—manœuvred until evening,—then repassed the river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
and bivouacked on the ground they had quitted in the
morning.</p>

<p>A quiet day succeeded. A supply of ammunition for the
breaching batteries had arrived from Almeida, a spirited cannonade
ensued, the British guns firing on San Vicente with
hot shot. The inflammable materials with which the fort was
built could not endure this destructive cannonade. The square
tower was speedily in a blaze—and in a brief space of time it
was totally consumed, while during the night the outworks
were frequently on fire, and at ten o’clock next morning the
whole convent was in flames. A breach had been made in
the gorge of Cayetano, and the troops formed for the assault,
when a white flag from the forts and redoubt announced that
the garrisons of both would treat for a surrender. But delay
appeared the chief object of the French commandant. Three
hours were required by him before he should capitulate, and
five minutes was the brief space that would be granted by the
besiegers, and when that time elapsed the storming parties
rushed forward,—the bastions were carried with feeble resistance,
and San Vicente with trifling loss. Thirty-six pieces
of cannon, seven hundred prisoners, and a quantity of stores
and clothing, fell into the hands of the victors, who had lost
some valuable officers and four hundred and fifty men before
these well-defended works.</p>

<p>At midnight Marmont commenced retiring,—and when day
broke, his columns were in full march, and his rear-guard
quitting its ground. The French set fire to the villages they
had occupied, leaving behind them an exhausted country and
an exasperated people. Nothing, indeed, could exceed the
deadly hatred that actuated the peasantry against their
oppressors, while the friendliest feelings were manifested
towards the British, who were by every class regarded as
deliverers. In Salamanca all was triumph and festivity.
High mass was celebrated in the cathedral,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> a grand dinner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>given by the commander of the allies, and a ball by the Junta
in the evening was attended by the noblesse of the city,
and witnessed the beauty of Spain united to the chivalry of
Britain.</p>

<p>Marmont retired by Tora and Tordesillas on the Douro,
and the allies, following his line of march, bivouacked on the
Guarena. The French marshal frequently made demonstrations
as if he intended to make a stand; but aware that
he should soon possess a numerical superiority over his able
opponent, he only manœuvred to gain time, while leisurely
falling back upon the line of the Douro, of which he possessed
the whole command. This gave the French marshal an
immense advantage over his antagonist. He held the bridges,
and of course had the means of crossing when he pleased—while
on the whole river from the mouth of the Pisuerga to
Zamora, the ford of Castro Nuno, three leagues above Toro,
was the only point by which an army could be passed over in
the presence of an enemy.</p>

<p>If the French marshal had this admitted advantage on his
side, in the possession of the line of the Douro, he had certainly
other difficulties to embarrass him. The guerillas were
in force on his flanks and in his rear, intercepting his convoys,
and giving full occupation to a part of his corps that were
required for a different service. These irregular bands were
incessantly on the alert, crippling his resources, and cutting
off stragglers and supplies. Sormel and Bombon were on his
right; Julian Sanchez on the left; Porlier disturbed the
country between him and the Asturias; and Mina and Duran
infested Navarre and Aragon. No wonder that Marmont
awaited Bonnet’s junction, with a portion of the army of the
north, with great anxiety. It was effected safely, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Duke of Ragusa was now numerically superior to his rival,
the entire French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i>, amounting to forty-seven
thousand men.</p>

<p>This increase of strength, when united to other considerations,
induced Wellington to decide on falling back towards
the frontier of Portugal. His military chest was nearly
exhausted—supplies must be exacted, after the iniquitous
system of the French, or the army subjected to privations;
and the very difficulty he must have found in removing his
wounded to the frontier, in the event of a hostile collision,
would have been quite sufficient to deter a cautious general,
and one so particular in attention to his troops when disabled,
from courting a battle on the banks of the Douro.</p>

<p>Marmont lost no time in concentrating between Toro and
San Roman. He passed the river on the evening of the 16th,
while Wellington moved the allies to Canizal and Fuente le
Pena. This was, however, a feint on the French marshal’s
part. At night he recrossed the Douro, made a rapid movement
on Tordesillas, passed the river there, and early on the
18th reached the Trebancos, after marching forty miles.
This movement was well designed and ably executed. By it
Marmont had placed himself in direct communication with
the army of the Centre, then moving from the capital to his
support—while an advance to Castrejon, endangered Anson’s
brigade of cavalry, and the fourth and light divisions.</p>

<p>As morning broke, the outlying pickets in front of Castrejon
were alarmed by a distant firing, which momently became
louder and more sustained. Presently Bock’s brigade were
observed retiring before the enemy’s dragoons and light artillery.
The British retreated by scattered squadrons, and thus
avoided the certain loss that a cannonade would occasion
cavalry retiring in dense masses. The infantry fell back in
perfect order—and though severely pressed by the French
divisions, threatened by the dragoons, and occasionally
under a fire of forty guns, reached the Guarena with trifling
loss.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>The bed of the river was nearly dry, but the troops found
its scanty waters a luxury above price, after a ten miles’ march<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
at times over vast corn-fields reaching above the knee, and
under a vertical sun, whose heat was most oppressive.
The retreat was resumed again, when the French cavalry
galloped up a hill commanding the line of march, with the
intention of holding the division in check, until the infantry
could overtake and bring it to action. But the British had
neared their reserves, and, tired of retreating, halted and
shewed front. A French brigade accepted the challenge, and
advanced instantly to the attack. The 27th and 40th regiments,
led on by General Cole, threw in a close volley, cheered,
and crossed bayonets; the enemy broke, the English cavalry
galloped in—and a general (Carrier), one gun, and three
hundred prisoners, were captured in the charge. The allied
loss in the different affairs of the 18th amounted to five hundred
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>That night, the allied troops halted on the Guarena, their
right extending beyond Canizal, and the left resting on Castrillo,
while the French bivouacked on the opposite side of
the valley. Fires blazed along the lines of either army, and
the outposts lay so near each other “<em>that the fixed sentinels
almost received the secret whispers of each other’s watch</em>.”</p>

<p>The night passed without alarm—all remained quiet until
the following day—when, at two o’clock, Marmont again
marched by his left on Tanazora, endeavouring to turn the
right of the allies. A counter movement was made by Lord
Wellington, both armies marching in nearly parallel lines,—while
an occasional cannonade, and an extensive conflagration
of corn ready for the sickle, told, at an immense distance, that
the game of war was going on.</p>

<p>It was generally believed that a battle on the plains of
Valesa was inevitable; and the troops bivouacked in two lines,
and before daybreak were under arms. But with the first
light, Marmont was seen again extending by his left, and the
allies moved consequently in a parallel direction. Either
commander might provoke an action, but neither seemed
inclined to risk one. The French marshal’s design was very
apparent. He kept the high ground, manœuvred to out-flank
his opponent, and, should opportunity permit, attack him at
advantage. His able antagonist, however, never gave the
chance. The day passed in manœuvring, and that night the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
French held Babila, Fuente, and Villamesa; the allies, Cabesa
and Aldea Lingua.</p>

<p>The 21st was also spent in flank marching, during which
both commanders crossed the Tormes; the French by the
fords of Alba and Huerta, and the allies by Santa Martha and
the bridge of Salamanca. The hostile armies bivouacked
again that night, and such a night can scarcely be imagined.</p>

<p>The evening was calm and sultry—but the extreme verge
of the horizon became heavily overcast, and persons conversant
with “skyey influences” might have easily foretold a coming
storm. It was now dusk—big drops began to fall, some of
the brigades had already reached the ground marked out for
their night positions, the guns were parked, and the horses of
the cavalry picketed. Others were, however, only moving to
their bivouacs; and Pakenham’s, the third division, being
separated from the remainder of the army by the Tormes, had
guarded against sudden attack by intrenching the commanding
height it rested on. Suddenly a torrent fell—the wind
rose and swept across the open hills with amazing violence—the
thunder-clouds burst—and, by the glare of lightning, the
sparkling arms of infantry masses were visible over the whole
extent of the position, as the last brigades pressed through the
tempest to occupy their ground. No shelter the allied army
could obtain could have averted a summer shower—and all in
a few minutes were drenched to the skin; while the cavalry
horses, scared by the lightning, broke from their picketings,
and trampling upon their riders rushed madly to and fro,
occasioning indescribable confusion. Many of the animals
were recovered by the exertions of the dragoons, but numbers
of the men were injured in the attempt, and thirty horses,
having got within Marmont’s lines, were secured by the
French. The allied position had its right upon one of two
hills called the Arapiles; its left below the ford of Santa
Martha; while its cavalry held Calvarasa de Abaxo. Marmont
occupied Calvarasa de Arriba and a contiguous hill,
called Neustra Senora de la Pena.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more imposing than the parallel movements
of the rival armies during the last three days. Far as
the eye could range, masses, apparently interminable, pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
their march with beautiful regularity—now displayed in brilliant
sunshine as they swept over a contiguous height—now
lost where an accidental dipping of the ground for a time concealed
the column. Generally both armies abstained from
hostile collision, by a sort of mutual consent; and excepting
where the line of march brought the light troops into immediate
proximity, or the occupation of a village produced a
trifling fusilade, the grand movements of the rival hosts
exhibited a “ceaseless march,” the leading columns pressing
forward toward the Tormes, and the rear hidden from view
“by dust and distance.”</p>

<p>The whole system of manœuvres, which marked the operations
of the French marshal since Bonnet’s division had joined
him on the Douro, shewed clearly that he only waited for a
fitting moment to attack. The French army were in high
spirits; while in numerical force they were formidable indeed,
numbering forty-five thousand men, of whom four thousand
were cavalry. Other circumstances were favourable to the
commencement of active aggression by the French. The
communications with the capital were open—reinforcements
constantly arriving—while a powerful accession of strength
had approached the immediate neighbourhood of the scene of
operations from the army of the North; a part of its cavalry
and horse-artillery having already reached Pollos.</p>

<p>If Marmont was anxious to offer battle, the British general,
for obvious reasons, was as willing to accept it. Aware of
his opponent’s abilities in tactics, and apprised of the fine
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of the army he commanded, Lord Wellington was as
confident in his own resources as in the indomitable courage of
that soldiery which, under his leading, had been frequently
assailed and never beaten. His own position was daily becoming
more unsafe. For security, the stores deposited at
Salamanca had been removed to the rear, consequently the
maintenance of his army was endangered, as supplies from the
depôts were tardily obtained. No difficulty, however, was
experienced by the French in provisioning their army—every
procurable necessary was exacted from the wretched inhabitants,
who might curse, while they durst not oppose those who
despoiled them of their property. Both commanders were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
anxious to try the issue of a contest. Vanity, in the one,
urged Marmont to offer battle upon ground favourable for the
movements of a force superior in number and perfect in every
arm. Prudence, in Lord Wellington, aimed at results only to
be effected by a victory. No wonder, then, that with such
dispositions a conflict was inevitable. The decree had gone
forth—a fiery trial of skill and valour must ensue—and well
did a fearful night harbinger “a bloody morrow.”</p>

<h2 id="chap_29">BATTLE OF SALAMANCA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Preliminary dispositions.—Marmont manœuvres to turn the right of the
Allies.—A false movement is seized on by Wellington, who instantly
attacks.—Opening, progress, and close of the battle of Salamanca.</p></blockquote>

<p>The morning was cloudy and threatening, and the dawn was
ushered in by a sharp fusilade, in the direction of Calvarasa
de Arriba. The enemy’s tirailleurs had occupied the heights
of Senora de la Pena in considerable force,—and part of the
seventh division, with the light cavalry of Victor Alten, were
opposing their farther advance.</p>

<p>The British right was appuied upon the nearest of the
Arapiles, and united itself with the extremity of a ridge, on
which the divisions had taken their position on the preceding
evening. Another hill, similarly named, rose from the plain
at a distance of five hundred yards,—and as it commanded the
right of the alignement, it was deemed advisable to possess it.</p>

<p>The French marshal, however, had entertained a similar
design; and a wood favouring the unobserved advance of part
of Bonnet’s division, the summit was occupied by the French
with their 122nd regiment, and a brigade of guns.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the enemy commenced extending to the left, in
the rear of the Arapiles, and formed on the skirts of a wood.
As the movement of the columns brought them within cannon
range, General Leith advanced a battery to a height in front
of his position, and it opened with considerable effect. The
French, obliged to retire, brought up a brigade of artillery to
check the British guns. Their diagonal fire silenced the
British battery,—and it was necessary, without delay, to retire
the guns, and withdraw a troop of the 16th light dragoons,
which, for their protection, had been drawn up under shelter
of the hill. This perilous evolution was executed with complete
success,—the ravine was passed at speed,—and with
little loss, the artillery and light cavalry regained the position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
The day wore on,—the late tempest apparently had cleared
the atmosphere,—all was bright and unclouded sunshine,—and
over a wide expanse of undulating landscape, nothing obscured
the range of sight but dust from the arid roads, or
wreathing smoke occasioned by the spattering fire of the light
troops. Marmont was busily manœuvring—and Lord Wellington
coolly noticing from a height the dispositions of his
opponent, which as he correctly calculated would lead to a
general engagement.</p>

<p>At noon, a combination of at least eight thousand men,
moved from the rear of the Arapiles, and formed in front of
the fifth division. Lord Wellington rode to the ground, and
there found the division in perfect readiness for the anticipated
attack. Perceiving at once that this movement was only a
demonstration of the French marshal to mask his real designs,
his lordship returned to the right, which was now the interesting
point of the position.</p>

<p>Finding his feint upon the fifth division unsuccessful, Marmont
put his columns into motion, and marching rapidly by
his left, endeavoured to turn the right of the allies, and thus
interpose between them and Ciudad Rodrigo. Under a heavy
cannonade, his front and flank, covered by a cloud of skirmishers,
and supported by a cavalry force that drove in the
British dragoons and light troops, pressed forward to gain the
Rodrigo road. But that hurried movement was badly executed
by Marmont’s generals of division. Their extension
was made with careless haste,—the line consequently weakened—and
this false manœuvre brought on the crisis of the day.
The moment for action had come; and Lord Wellington seized
the opportunity and struck the blow.</p>

<p>At two o’clock, when the French commenced extending by
their left, the allied army was thus disposed. On the right,
the fifth division (Leith’s) had moved behind the village of
Arapiles, and had taken ground on the right of the fourth
(Cole’s); the sixth and seventh, under Generals Clinton and
Hope, formed a reserve; the third division (Pakenham’s),
D’Urban’s cavalry, two squadrons of the 14th light dragoons,
and a corps of Spanish infantry, were in position near Aldea
Tejada. Bradford’s brigade, with Le Marchant’s heavy
cavalry, were formed on the right, and in the rear of the fifth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
The light division (Barnard’s) and the first (the Guards and
Germans) were drawn up between the Arapiles and the Tormes
in reserve. Cotton’s cavalry were formed in the rear of the
third and fifth divisions; an artillery reserve, posted behind
the dragoons, and in the rear of all the Spaniards, under Don
Carlos D’Espana, appeared in the extreme distance, but entirely
out of fire.</p>

<p>Marmont had remarked, and rode forward to correct the
irregularity of his flank movement, and personally direct the
débouchement of his third and fourth divisions from the
wood that had partially concealed them. At that moment,
Lord Wellington was seated on the hill-side, eating his hurried
meal, while an aide-de-camp in attendance watched the
enemy’s movements with a glass. The bustle then perceptible
in the French line attracted his lordship’s notice, and he
quickly inquired the cause. “They are evidently in motion,”
was the reply.—“Indeed! what are they doing?”—“Extending
rapidly to the left,” was answered. Lord Wellington
sprang upon his feet, and seized the telescope; then muttering
that Marmont’s good genius had deserted him, he mounted his
horse, and issued the orders to attack.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
All was instantly on the alert. The staff went off at speed
to bring up the fifth and sixth divisions. The infantry stood
to arms, primed and loaded, fixed bayonets, uncased the colours,
and abandoning the defensive system, hitherto so admirably
employed, prepared for an immediate attack.</p>

<p>Pakenham<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> commenced the action by advancing in four
columns along the valley, assailing the left flank of the enemy,
and driving it before him in great confusion. D’Urban’s
Portuguese dragoons, and Harvey’s light cavalry (the 14th),
protected the flank during the movement, and, when the
French became disordered, charged boldly in and sabred the
broken infantry. Nothing could be more brilliant than Pakenham’s
advance. A level plateau of nearly eight hundred yards
was to be crossed before the assailants could reach the heights,
whither Foy’s division were marching hastily to occupy the
ground. A heavy fire from the French guns was showered
on the advancing columns, while the British batteries, under
Captain Douglass, replied by a furious cannonade. Wallace’s
brigade—the 45th, 74th, and 88th—formed the first line, and
moved forward in open column. The face of the height was
covered with tirailleurs,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> who kept up an incessant fusilade—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
while grape and canister ploughed the ground, occasioning a
heavy loss, and more particularly to the centre. They suffered,
but they could not be checked;—not waiting to deploy, the
companies brought forward their right shoulders in a run,
forming line from open column without halting; while the
wings of the brigade, having moved up the hill with less impediments
than the centre, were more advanced, and the line
thus assumed rather the figure of a crescent. All the mounted
officers, regardless of a withering fusilade, were riding in front
of the battalions, and the men following with their muskets at
the rest. At last they reached the brow. Foy’s division, beating
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pas de charge</i>, advanced, and threw in a murderous
volley. Half the British front rank went down. Staggered
by that deadly fire, the brigade recoiled a step or two, but,
instantly recovering, the rear rank filled the places of the fallen.
On it went with imposing steadiness, regardless of the irregular
fusilade, for the French continued to pour in their fire with
more rapidity than effect.</p>

<p>Foy’s division, alarmed by this movement, became unsteady.
The daring advance of an enemy, whom the concentrated fire
of five thousand muskets could not arrest, was indeed astounding.
All that brave men could do was done by the French
officers. They strove to confirm the courage of their troops,
and persuade them to withstand an assault that threatened
their wavering ranks. The colonel of the 22nd <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">légère</i>, seizing
a musket from a grenadier, rushed forward, and mortally
wounded Major Murphy of the 88th. Speedily his death was
avenged—a Ranger shot the Frenchman through the head,
who tossing his arms wildly up, fell forward and expired. The
brigade betrayed impatience; the 88th, excited to madness by
the fall of a favourite officer, who passed dead along their
front, as his charger galloped off with his rider’s foot sticking
in the stirrup, could scarcely be kept back. Pakenham
marked the feeling, and ordered Wallace “to let them loose.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
The word was given—down came the bayonets to the charge—the
pace quickened—a wild cheer, mingled with the Irish
<em>slogan</em>, rent the skies—and unable to stand the shock, the
French gave ground. The Rangers, and the supporting regiments,
broke the dense mass of infantry, bayoneting all whom
they could overtake—until, run to a regular stand-still, they
halted to recover breath and stayed the slaughter.</p>

<p>Nor were the operations of the fifth division less marked
and brilliant. For an hour they had been exposed to a heavy
cannonade, sheltering occasionally on the ground from the shot
and shells, which fell in showers upon the height they occupied,
and ricochetted through their ranks. At last the order
to advance was given. They moved in two lines, the first
entirely British, the second composed of the Portuguese infantry
of General Spry. Bradford’s brigade, having united
itself for the attack, formed on the right of the fifth.</p>

<p>In mounting the height where the French division was
posted, the assailing columns were annoyed by a sharp discharge
of artillery, and the fire of a swarm of sharpshooters,
who in extended order occupied the face of the hill. The
British light infantry pushed on to clear the line of march,
and, if practicable, make a dash at the enemy’s artillery. The
tirailleurs were speedily driven back, the cannon removed
from the crest of the height to the rear, and unimpeded, the
division moved up the hill with a perfect regularity in its formation,
and the imposing steadiness of men who marched to
victory. “In the front of the centre of that beautiful line
rode General Leith, directing its movements, and regulating
its advance.”</p>

<p>The enemy were preparing for the struggle. He retired
his columns from the ridge, and formed continuous squares,
fifty paces from the crest of the heights, which the assailants
must crown previous to attacking. The artillery from the
French rear cannonaded the advancing columns, but nothing
could check the progressive movement of the British. “The
men marched with the same orderly steadiness as at first; no
advance in line at a review was ever more correctly executed;
the dressing was admirable; and spaces were no sooner formed
by casualties, than closed up with the most perfect regularity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
and without the slightest deviation from the order of
march.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>When General Leith reached the summit of the hill, the
enemy were observed formed in supporting squares, with their
front rank kneeling. Their formation was complete—their fire
reserved—and till the drum rolled, not a musket was discharged.
Nearly at the same moment, the French squares
and the British line delivered their volleys. A dense smoke
hid all for a time from view. A loud and sustained cheer
pealed from the English ranks: no shout of defiance answered
it; while rushing forward, the British broke the squares, and
pressing on with dauntless impetuosity, every attempt at opposition
ceased, and what just now appeared a disciplined
body, almost too formidable to be assailed, became a disorganized
mass, flying at headlong speed from the fury of its conquerors.
To increase the confusion, a portion of Foy’s division
crossed the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i>, and mingled with it—while the rush of
advancing cavalry was heard, and that sound, so ominous to
broken infantry, confirmed the panic.</p>

<p>Presently the heavy brigade—the 3rd and 4th dragoons,
and 5th dragoon guards—galloped across the interval of
ground, between the heights where the third division had
made its flank attack, and the fifth its more direct one.
Sweeping through a mob of half-armed fugitives, the brigade
rode boldly at the three battalions of the French 66th, which
had formed in six supporting lines to check the advance of
the conquerors, and afford time for the broken divisions to
have their organization restored. Heedless of its searching
fire, the British dragoons penetrated and broke the columns;
numbers of the French were sabred; while the remainder
were driven back upon the third division and made prisoners.
Still pressing on, another regiment, in close order, presented
itself; this, too, was charged, broken, and cut down. Nothing
arrested Le Marchant’s victorious career until the ground
became gradually obstructed with trees, embarrassing the
movements of his cavalry, while it afforded a broken infantry
ample time to rally, and engage horsemen at evident advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Although the regiments of the heavy brigade in the course
of these brilliant charges had of necessity become intermixed,
and their line crowded, without intervals between the squadrons,
they still pushed forward without confusion to charge a
brigade that had formed under cover of the trees. The French
steadily awaited the attack—within twenty yards their reserved
fire was thrown in, and on a concentrated body of horse
and at this short distance, its effect was fatal. General Le
Marchant was killed—Colonel Elley badly wounded—while
one-third of the brigade were brought to the ground by that
close and murderous volley. Still, those of the heavy dragoons
who could keep their saddles, sustained nobly the reputation
they had earned that day, and charging the French column
home, penetrated and dispersed it. A furious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i> succeeded—the
scattered infantry fighting desperately to the last—while
the long straight sword of the trooper proved in English
hands irresistible.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>While the remnant of the cavalry brigade continued their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
pursuit, a small battery of five guns was seen upon the left.
Lord Edward Somerset instantly galloped down, charged, and
brought them off. The brigade was then retired, after a
continued succession of brilliant charges that had lasted nearly
an hour.</p>

<p>Of course the loss sustained was great. From three splendid
regiments that had ridden into action, at least one thousand
strong, with difficulty three squadrons were formed in the
evening—such being the number of men and horses rendered
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, during its late scene of brilliant but dear-bought
success.</p>

<p>With such decided advantages, the battle might have been
considered gained, and the French defeat inevitable. But the
splendid successes attendant on the third and fifth divisions,
with Bradford’s Portuguese brigade, and the light and heavy
cavalry, were nearly counterbalanced by the total failure of
Pack’s attack on the Arapiles, and the repulse of Cole’s division
by that of Bonnet.</p>

<p>The 1st and 16th Portuguese advanced to carry the height;
it was occupied by a French battalion, and protected by a battery
of guns. A force of nearly two thousand men, led on in
person by a “fighting general,” should have wrested the hill
from such inferior force, no matter how strong the ground
might naturally have been. On this occasion, however, the
attack proved totally unsuccessful—the Portuguese regiments
recoiled from the fire—and their officers endeavoured to rally
them in vain. The attack on the Arapiles was consequently
abandoned, the French left in undisturbed possession, and,
unassailed themselves, they turned their musketry and cannon
upon the flank and rear of Cole’s division, who, under the impression
that Pack’s assault must have succeeded, had fearlessly
advanced across the plain, driving Bonnet’s corps before
it, with the promise of as glorious results as had attended the
gallant operations of the third and fifth.</p>

<p>At that moment, even when the fourth division believed
itself victorious, its position was most dangerous—its very
existence more than doubtful. Bonnet perceiving Pack’s
failure, reformed his division, still numerically superior to his
opponent’s, advanced boldly against the fourth, and furiously
attacked it—while from the crest of the Arapiles, the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
troops poured upon the now retreating columns a withering
fire of grape and musketry. General Cole was carried off the
field; Beresford, who had come to his relief, with a Portuguese
brigade of the fifth, was also badly wounded. The
British were falling fast; while the French heavy cavalry,
under Boyer, moved rapidly to support Bonnet, who was
momentarily gathering strength from the junction of the
scattered soldiers who had escaped the slaughter of the fourth
and seventh French divisions, already <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dérouted</i> on the left.</p>

<p>Wellington marked the emergency, and ordered Clinton’s
division to advance. This fine and unbroken corps, numbering
six thousand bayonets, pushed rapidly forward, confronted the
victorious enemy, who, with loud cheers, were gaining ground
on every point, as the hard-pressed fourth division was driven
back by overwhelming numbers. Bonnet, determined to
follow up his temporary success, met Clinton’s division manfully,
and for a time neither would give ground, and a close
and furious conflict resulted. The ceaseless roll of musketry,
and the thunder of fifty guns, told how furiously the battle-ground
was disputed. Both fought desperately,—and though
night was closing, the withered grass, blazing on the surface
of the hill, threw an unearthly glare upon the combatants, and
displayed the alternations that attended the “heady fight.”
But the British bayonet, at last, opened the path to victory.
Such a desperate encounter could not endure—the French
began to waver,—the sixth division cheered, pushed forward,
gained ground,—while, no longer able to withstand an enemy
who seemed determined to sweep every thing before it, the
French retired in confusion, leaving the hard-contested field in
undisputed possession of the island conquerors.</p>

<p>Darkness fell. The remains of Bonnet’s division found
shelter in the woods, or crossed the Tormes at the ford of
Alba, which, from its natural strength, the Spaniards could
have easily defended. The conflict, at different points, had
raged six hours with unabated fury; and those of the divisions
which had been engaged, exhausted with fatigue and
suffering dreadfully from heat and thirst, rested on the battle-ground.</p>

<p>The guards, Germans, and light brigade, who had been in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
reserve during the day, however, pushed forward in pursuit.
Distant musketry was heard occasionally—gradually this
spattering fire ceased—and the groans of dying men and
wounded horses succeeded the headlong rush of cavalry, the
thunder of a hundred guns, the shout of proud defiance, and,
wilder still, the maddening cry of victory!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_30">SALAMANCA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Results of the battle.—Operations.—Surprise at Majalahonda.—Capture
of the Retiro.—Occupation of Madrid.</p></blockquote>

<p>Salamanca, whether considered with regard to its merits as
a battle, or its results as a victory, probably stands foremost
among the Peninsular contests—and many and peculiar traits
distinguish it from every previous encounter. It was coolly
and advisedly fought, by commanders confident in themselves,
satisfied with the strength and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of their armies,
jealous of each other’s reputation, and stimulated, by every
longing after military glory, to exhaust the resources of their
genius and experience to secure a successful issue. Nothing
could surpass Marmont’s beautiful manœuvring for consecutive
days while moving round the British flank, except the countervailing
rapidity with which his talented opponent defeated
every effort to outflank him, and held the marshal constantly
in check. At two on the 22nd, the French marshal threatened
an attack; at four, he was himself the assailed—and the
same mistake that lost Marengo, involved ruin and defeat at
Salamanca. One false movement, that might have been easily
corrected before a slower leader could see and seize the
momentary advantage, brought on a crisis that clouded the
French destinies in Spain, by removing the delusory belief
that their arms should eventually prove invincible.</p>

<p>A conflict, close and desperate like that of Salamanca, conferred
a sanguinary victory, while it involved a still bloodier
defeat. The allied loss, in killed and wounded, exceeded five
thousand men, and this, of course, fell chiefly on the British.
The Portuguese, comparatively, suffered little—and the
Spaniards, being entirely non-combatant, had very few casualties
to record.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> The only post intrusted—and that most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
unhappily—to their charge, was the castle of Alba; and this
was abandoned without a shot, leaving Clausel a safe retreat,
while its vigorous occupation must have involved his total
ruin.</p>

<p>The French loss was never correctly ascertained. Two
eagles, eleven pieces of cannon, seven thousand prisoners, and
as many dead soldiers left upon the field, were the admitted
trophies of British victory. Among the commanding officers
of both armies, the casualties were immense: of the British,
Le Marchant was killed; Beresford, Cole, Leith, Cotton, and
Alten wounded. The French were equally unfortunate—the
generals of brigade, Thomières, Ferrey, and Desgraviers
were killed; Marmont, early in the day, mutilated
by a howitzer shell;<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> Bonnet severely, and Clausel slightly
wounded.</p>

<p>The light division, when morning dawned, continued its
advance, crossing the Tormes at Huerta; while the heavy
Germans, under Bock, overtook the French rear-guard in
position on the heights of La Serna, protected by some
squadrons of hussars. These were dispersed by a charge of
the 11th and 16th—while the heavy brigade rode directly at
the squares, and broke them by a furious onset. Numbers
were cut down—others saved themselves by throwing away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
their arms, hiding in the woods, and afterwards joining the
retreating columns. In this spirited affair nearly one thousand
prisoners fell into the hands of the victors.</p>

<p>As a cavalry exploit, that of La Serna has rarely been
equalled, and never, in its brilliant results, surpassed. Bock’s
casualties were comparatively trifling, amounting in killed and
wounded only to some seventy or eighty men.</p>

<p>Clausel, who commanded <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en chef</i> after Marmont was
disabled, retreated with great rapidity. Viewed from the
summit of La Serna, the French exhibited a countless mass of
all arms, confusedly intermingled. While the range permitted
it, the horse-artillery annoyed them with round-shot—but, by
rapid marching, they gradually disappeared—while, opportunely,
a strong corps of cavalry and a brigade of guns
joined from the army of the North, and covered the retreat
until they fell back upon their reserves.</p>

<p>Although Salamanca was in every respect a decisive battle,
how much more fatal must it not have proved, had darkness
not shut in, and robbed the conquerors of half the fruits of
victory? The total demolition of the French left was effected
by six o’clock, and why should the right attack have not been
equally successful? Had such been the case, in what a hopeless
situation the broken army must have found itself! The
Tormes behind, a reserve of three entire divisions, who during
the contest had scarcely drawn a trigger, ready to assail in
front—nothing could have averted total ruin; and to the
French, Salamanca would have proved the bloodiest field on
record. One great error stripped victory of its results. Either
the small force by which the Arapiles was defended had been
undervalued, or incompetent means employed by Lord Wellington
to carry it. Unfortunately a Portuguese brigade had
been intrusted with that service. They were admirably led
on—conquest was on the wing around them—everywhere the
advance of the British was triumphant—their numerical force
was five times greater than that of the defenders of the height—but
the attack was feebly made, and, on the show of a
determined resistance, as quickly abandoned. This unexpected
reverse induced Bonnet’s corps to rally—and by it, the fourth
division was suddenly and unexpectedly assailed. A plunging
fire from the Arapiles fell upon their flank and rear—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
tide of battle turned—the fourth gave ground—and, as yet
untamed by British steel, the enemy cheered loudly and rushed
on—and had not Clinton’s division been promptly carried into
action, it is hard to conjecture what serious results might not
have arisen from this singular repulse. Finally, the battle
was restored and won—but an immense waste of blood and
time supervened—and while the protracted struggle entailed
on the victors a desperate loss, it secured the vanquished from
total ruin. Favoured by the darkness, Marmont’s routed
columns removed themselves from the field, while guns and
trophies<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> were secured by the retiring army, that, with one
hour’s light, must have fallen into the hands of the conquerors.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Still, and with all these mischances, Salamanca was a great
and influential victory. Accidental circumstances permitted
Clausel to withdraw a beaten army from the field, and a
fortunate junction of those arms, which alone could cover his
retreat, enabled him, with little loss, to outmarch his pursuers,
preserve his communications, and fall back upon his reserves.
But at Salamanca the delusory notion of French superiority
was destroyed. The enemy discovered that they must
measure strength with opponents in every point their equals.
The confidence of wavering allies was confirmed; while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
evacuation of Madrid, the abandonment of the siege of Cadiz,
the deliverance of Andalusia and Castile from military occupation,
and the impossibility of reinforcing Napoleon during
his northern campaign, by sparing any troops from the corps
in the Peninsula<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>—all these great results were among the
important consequences that arose from Marmont’s defeat upon
the Tormes.</p>

<p>The joy evinced by the inhabitants of Salamanca at the
total discomfiture of their French oppressors, was only equalled
by the despair with which the regressive movement of Lord
Wellington from the line of the Agueda had previously been
witnessed. From all the high grounds about the city, the
changes of the fight had been watched with painful anxiety;
and when the struggle ended and the day was won, mules and
cars loaded with refreshments were despatched from Salamanca
to the field of battle, where they arrived before break of day.
Hospitals were prepared for the reception of the wounded, and
every exertion employed to assuage the sufferings of their
gallant allies. High mass was celebrated in the cathedral,
and a wild display of popular exultation was everywhere
visible in the streets. All had assumed the appearance of a
carnival; and the guitar and castanet were heard at midnight
in the same square that, a short period before, had started at
“the beat to arms.”</p>

<p>Lord Wellington, who had been present while mass was
celebrated for his victory,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> without delay commenced his
march southward, and moved as rapidly as he could, in the
vain hope of overtaking the enemy’s rear-guard. Clausel,
intending to join the army of the North, fell back on Arivalo;
but Joseph Buonaparte, on learning Marmont’s defeat, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
retreated himself—and thus Clausel was obliged to change his
line for that of the Camino Real, in order to cross the Duero
at Tudela. There, too, he failed in effecting his expected
junction with the troops that had garrisoned Madrid; and,
abandoning his hospitals at Valladolid, he fell back at once on
Burgos.</p>

<p>The British advance was unopposed. Everywhere the
conquerors were received with <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vivas</i>; while fruit, wine, and
all the refreshments they could command, were liberally supplied
them by the Spanish peasantry. At Valladolid, all hope
of coming up with Clausel ended; and Lord Wellington
halted on the 30th of July, to enable the rear to close up.
Then turning at once, he quitted his previous route, and took
the road to the capital.</p>

<p>Nothing impeded the victor’s march as he moved direct on
Madrid. On the 6th of August, Wellington halted at Cuellar,
leaving Clinton’s division there, with the regiments that had
suffered on the 21st most severely, to observe any movement
that Marmont’s corps might make. Next morning he moved
upon the capital, while Hill’s division marched on Zafra.</p>

<p>Nothing checked Lord Wellington’s movement on Madrid.
On the 7th of August, he reached Segovia; and on the 9th,
San Ildefonso,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> the magnificent summer residence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
Spanish monarchs. There he halted to allow his right to come
up; and among the exquisite groves and gardens that had
formed a favourite retreat to a kingly race for centuries, the
conquerors of Salamanca rested. On the 11th the march was
resumed; and as the passes of the Guadarama were undefended,
the allies entered New Castile without any opposition,
and halted within a march of Madrid.</p>

<p>After a careful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i> in company with his lieutenant,
Marshal Jourdan, Joseph Buonaparte declared that the
capital was untenable, and retreated on Aranguez, after leaving
a garrison in the Retiro.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>On the evening of the 11th, the army of Lord Wellington
was comfortably bivouacked three miles in the rear of Majalahonda.
The Portuguese cavalry, under D’Urban, forming the
advanced guard, were pushed forward a mile beyond the village,
in which two regiments of German dragoons, and Macdonald’s
brigade of horse artillery, were posted to support
them. Some trifling skirmishing had taken place during the
day, between the Portuguese cavalry and the French lancers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
who formed part of Joseph’s Buonaparte’s escort, but it led to
no serious result. No hostile movement was apprehended—all
foretold a quiet night—when suddenly the horse-artillery
opened in front of the village, and announced that the outposts
were attacked. In a few minutes it was ascertained that the
Portuguese dragoons had given way—and indeed, their flight
was most disgraceful; they rode off at speed, without crossing
a sabre, leaving their brave supporters, the horse-artillery,
surrounded by the enemy. Nor was theirs a momentary panic—the
fugitives dashed through the village of Majalahonda,
without an attempt to rally—while many of the startled horsemen
there were cut down before they could reach their saddles,
and their colonel was killed in the act of dressing.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> But
still, though surprised, the Germans maintained their well-won
reputation; these gallant troopers charged as they best could;
and in small bodies, sword in hand, met, checked, and at last
fairly drove back the lancers. The cowardice of the Portuguese
on this occasion was indefensible—they had scarcely a
casualty to shew—while, of the brave men who fought so
gallantly, half-armed and surprised, two hundred were put
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, one hundred and twenty horses carried off, and
three guns taken. The cannon were recovered—but, to use
the words of an amusing writer, whose military descriptions
are lively and characteristic<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>—“it was one of the most disgraceful
and unlooked-for events that had taken place during
the campaign. To be beaten at any time was bad enough;
but to be beaten by a handful of lancers on the eve of our
entering Madrid, almost in view of the city, was worse
than all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
Next day, Wellington entered the capital, amidst the enthusiastic
acclamations of such of the inhabitants as remained.
The Retiro was immediately invested—and after a show of
resistance, surrendered on the morning of the 14th.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Besides
two thousand prisoners, one hundred and ninety pieces
of cannon, nine hundred barrels of powder, twenty thousand
stand of arms, two millions of musket cartridges, and the eagles
of the 13th and 51st regiments, fell into the hands of the
victors. A large supply of cables and cordage was fortunately
discovered in the Casa del Campo; and with these materials
the broken arch of the bridge at Alcantara was repaired by
the Royal Staff corps.</p>

<p>The occupation of Madrid carried out the effects produced
by the victory of Salamanca. French domination received a
death-blow—and the power of Napoleon a shock from which
it never afterwards recovered.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_31">CAPTURE OF MADRID.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Reasons for abandoning Madrid.—Clausel driven back.—Siege of Burgos
commenced.—Horn-work of San Michael stormed.—Second assault
fails.—Continuation of the siege.—First line carried by assault.—French
sally successful.—Fourth assault fails.—Siege raised.</p></blockquote>

<p>The occupation of Madrid was among the most brilliant
epochs of Peninsular history, and, from circumstances, it
was also among the briefest. The conquest of the capital was
certainly a splendid exploit. It told that Wellington held a
position and possessed a power that in England many doubted
and more denied; and those, whose evil auguries had predicted
a retreat upon the shipping, and finally an abandonment
of the country, were astounded to find the allied leader
victorious in the centre of Seville, and dating his general
orders from the palace of the Spanish kings. The desertion
of his capital by the usurper, proclaimed the extent of Wellington’s
success; and proved that his victories were not,
as had been falsely asserted at home, “conquests only in
name.”</p>

<p>Without entering into military history too extensively, it
will be necessary to observe, that on many expected events
which should have strengthened his means, and weakened
those of his opponents, Lord Wellington was miserably disappointed.
Maitland’s diversion on Catalonia had proved a
failure. Ballasteros exhibited the impotent assumption of
free action, and refused obedience to the orders of the British
general—and Hill was therefore obliged to leave Estremadura,
to cover the three roads to Madrid. The Cortes, instead of
straining their energies to meet the exigencies of the moment,
wasted time in framing new constitutions, and in desultory
and idle debates,—while Wellington, removed from his supplies—his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
military chest totally exhausted,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> and his communications
menaced, was imperatively obliged to open others,
and secure assistance from the only place on which reliance
could be reposed—the mother country.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, full time to move. The Spanish army were
driven from Gallicia, and Clausel threatened to interrupt the
communications of the allies with Portugal. Lord Wellington,
therefore, decided on marching against the army he had
beaten at Salamanca; and leaving Hill’s division to cover the
capital, he left Madrid on the 1st of September, and crossing
the Douro on the 6th, moved on Burgos by Valencia.</p>

<p>That night Clausel abandoned Valladolid, and after crossing
the Pisuerga, destroyed the bridge of Berecal. Anxious to
unite with Castanos, Wellington waited for the Gallician
army to come up—while Clausel leisurely retreated through
the valleys of Arlanzan and Pisuerga, as remarkable for
beauty and fertility, as for the endless succession of strong
posts which they afforded to a retiring army.</p>

<p>Clausel, after an able retreat, took a position at Cellada del
Camino—and to cover Burgos, offered battle to the allied
commander. The challenge was promptly accepted; but the
French general, discovering that a junction of twelve thousand
Spaniards had strongly reinforced his antagonist, prudently
declined a combat, retired, and united his own to Souham’s
corps, which numbered above eight thousand men. This
reserve had been organized by Napoleon’s special orders—and
was intended to remedy any discomfiture which might
befall Marmont in the event of his being defeated by the
allies.</p>

<p>The British entered the city of Burgos, from which the
French had previously retired, after garrisoning the castle
with two thousand five hundred men, under the command of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
General Dubreton. Twelve thousand allied troops, comprising
the first and sixth British divisions, with two Portuguese
brigades, sat down before the place; while the remainder of
Lord Wellington’s army, amounting to twenty-five thousand
effective troops, formed the covering army of the siege.</p>

<p>The castle of Burgos was a weak fortress, on which French
ingenuity had done wonders in rendering it defensible at all.
It stood on a bold and rocky height, and was surrounded by
three distinct lines, each placed within the other, and variously
defended. The lower and exterior line consisted of
the ancient wall that embraced the bottom of the hill, and
which Caffarelli had strengthened by the addition of a modern
parapet, with salient<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and re-entering flanks. The second
was a field retrenchment, strongly palisaded. The third, a
work of like construction, having two elevated points, on one
of which the ancient keep of the castle stood, and on the other,
a well-intrenched building called the White Church; and
that being the most commanding point, it was provided with
a casemated work, and named in honour of Napoleon. This
battery domineered all around, excepting on its northern face,
where the hill of St. Michael rising nearly to a level with the
fortress, was defended by an extensive hornwork,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> having a
sloping scarp and counterscarp, the former twenty-five feet in
height, the latter, ten. Although in an unfinished state, and
merely palisaded, it was under the fire of the castle and the
Napoleon battery. The guns, already mounted, comprised
nine heavy cannon, eleven field-pieces, and six mortars and
howitzers; and, as the reserve artillery and stores of the army
of Portugal were deposited in the castle of Burgos, General
Dubreton had the power of increasing his armament to any
extent he thought fit.</p>

<p>Two days passed before the allies could cross the river. On
the 19th the passage was effected, and the French outposts on
St. Michael were driven in. That night, the hornwork itself
was carried after a sanguinary assault—the British losing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
in this short and murderous affair upwards of four hundred
men.</p>

<p>From the hill—now in possession of the allies—it was
decided that the future operations should be carried on, and
the engineers arranged that each line in succession should be
taken by assault. The place, on a close examination, was
ascertained to be in no respect formidable; but the means to
effect its reduction, by comparison, were feebler still. Nothing,
indeed, could be less efficient—three long 18-pounders, and
five 24-pound howitzers, formed the entire siege artillery that
Lord Wellington could obtain.</p>

<p>The head-quarters were fixed at Villa Toro. The engineering
department intrusted to Colonel Burgoyne, and the charge
of the artillery to colonels Robe and Dickson.</p>

<p>The second assault, that upon the exterior wall, was made on
the night of the 22nd by escalade. Major Laurie of the 79th,
with detachments from the different regiments before the place,
formed the storming party. The Portuguese, who led the attack,
were quickly repulsed—and though the British entered
the ditch, they never could mount a ladder. Those who attempted
it were bayoneted from above—while shells, combustibles,
and cold shot were hurled on the assailants, who, after
a most determined effort for a quarter of an hour, were driven
from the ditch, leaving their leader, and half the number who
composed the storming party, killed and wounded.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>After this disastrous failure, an unsuccessful attempt to
breach the wall was tried—in effecting which, of the few guns
in battery, two were totally disabled by the commanding fire
of the castle—and the engineers resorted, from sheer necessity,
to sap and mine. The former, from the plunging fire kept up
from the enemy’s defences, and which occasioned a fearful loss,
was speedily abandoned; but the latter was carried vigorously
on—and the outward wall mined, charged,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> and on the 29th,
exploded.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock at night the hose was fired—the storming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
party having previously formed in a hollow way some fifty
paces from the gallery. When the mine was sprung, a portion
of the wall came down, and a sergeant and four privates, who
formed the forlorn hope, rushed through the smoke, mounted
the ruins, and bravely crowned the breach. But in the darkness,
which was intense, the storming party and their supporting
companies, missed their way—and the French recovering
from their surprise, rushed to the breach, and drove the few
brave men who held it back to the trenches. The attack, consequently,
failed, and from a scarcity of shot no fire could be
turned on the ruins. Dubreton availed himself of this accidental
advantage—and by daylight, the breach was rendered
impracticable again.</p>

<p>Still determined to gain the place, Lord Wellington continued
operations, although twelve days had elapsed since he had sat
down before it. A singular despondency, particularly among
the Portuguese, had arisen from those two failures; while insubordination
was creeping into the British regiments, which
produced a relaxed discipline that could not be overlooked,
and which, in general orders, was consequently strongly censured.</p>

<p>The siege continued; and, on the 4th of October, a battery
opened from Saint Michael’s against the old breach, while the
engineers announced that a powerful mine was prepared for
springing. At five o’clock that evening, the fusee was fired.
The effect was grand and destructive—one hundred feet of the
wall was entirely demolished, and a number of the French,
who happened to be near it, were annihilated by the explosion.
The 24th regiment, already in readiness to storm, instantly
rushed forward, and both breaches were carried, but, unfortunately,
with heavy loss.</p>

<p>A lodgment was immediately effected—and preparations
made for breaching the second line of defence where it joined
the first.</p>

<p>On the 5th, early in the evening, the French sallied with
three hundred men. The attack was too successful—one
hundred and fifty of the guard and working party were killed
or wounded—the gabions overturned—the works at the lodgment
injured—and the intrenching tools carried off.</p>

<p>That night, however, the damage was repaired—the sap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
was rapidly carried forward—and at last, the British had got
so close to the wall, that their own howitzers ceased firing, lest
the workmen should be endangered by their shot. The guns
on Saint Michael’s battery had also breached with good effect,
and fifty feet of the parapet of the second line was completely
laid in ruins. But, in effecting these successes, a heavy loss
was inflicted on the besiegers—and of their originally small
means for carrying on a siege, the few pieces of artillery they
possessed at first, were now reduced to one serviceable gun.</p>

<p>The weather had also changed, and rain fell in quantities
and filled the trenches. A spirit of discontent and indifference
pervaded the army. The labour was unwillingly performed—the
guards loosely kept—and Dubreton again sallied furiously,
drove off the working party, destroyed the new parallel, carried
away the tools, and occasioned a loss of more than two hundred
men. Among the killed, none was lamented more than
Colonel Cocks, who having obtained promotion most deservedly
for previous gallantry, died at the head of his men, while
rallying the fugitives and repelling the sally.</p>

<p>Three assaults had failed—but still the allied commander
did not quit the place in despair. Preparations for another
attempt were continued—and the exertions of the engineers,
of whom one-half had fallen, were redoubled. Heated shot
was tried against the White Church unsuccessfully; while
that of San Roman was marked as the more vulnerable point,
and a gallery commenced against it.</p>

<p>On the 17th, the great breach was again exposed by the fire
of the British guns, and the ramparts on either side extensively
damaged. A mine beneath the lower parallel was successfully
exploded, and a lodgment effected in a cavalier,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
from whence the French had kept up a destructive fire on the
trenches. It was held but for a short time, as the enemy
came down in force, and drove the besiegers from it. On the
18th, the breach was reported practicable, and an assault
decided on—the signal arranged being the springing of the
mine beneath the church of San Roman. That building was
also to be assailed, while the old breach was to be attempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
by escalade—and thus, and at the same moment, three distinct
attacks would occupy the enemy’s attention.</p>

<p>At half-past four the explosion of the mine gave the signal.
A countermine was immediately sprung by the French, and
between both, the church was partially destroyed, and Colonel
Browne, with some Portuguese and Spanish troops, seized
upon the ruined building. The Guards, who had volunteered
a detachment, rushed through the old breach, escaladed the
second line, and, in front of the third, encountered the French
in considerable force—while two hundred of the German
Legion, under Major Wurmb, carried the new breach,
pushing up the hill, and fairly gaining the third line of the
defences. Unfortunately, however, these daring and successful
efforts were not supported with the promptness that was
needed. The French reserves were instantly advanced—they
came on in overwhelming force—cleared the breaches of the
assailants—and drove them beyond the outer line, with the loss
of two hundred officers and men.</p>

<p>San Roman was taken the following night by the French,
and recovered again by the British. But with this affair the
siege virtually terminated—and Lord Wellington, by an imperious
necessity, was obliged to retire from a place of scarcely
third-rate character, after four attacks by assault, and a loss of
two thousand men.</p>

<p>In war, the bravest and the most prudent measures are
frequently marred or made by fortune. Lord Wellington, with
very insufficient means, attempted the reduction of Burgos;
and although skill and gallantry were displayed in every essay,
obstacles arose which checked the most daring efforts; and all
that science and determination could effect, were vainly tried
to overcome difficulties physically insurmountable. Had
Wellington possessed the requisite <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> for the conduct of
a siege, Burgos must have been taken in a week.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
But let justice be done to its defenders. Much was expected
from them—and assuredly, the governor and garrison of the
castle of Burgos realized the high reliance placed upon their
skill and heroism by their countrymen.</p>

<p>On the 18th, the British corps united. On the 20th some
trifling affairs occurred between the outposts—and on the 21st
the siege of Burgos was regularly raised, and Lord Wellington
issued orders for retiring from before the place.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_32">RETREAT FROM BURGOS.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Retreat commences.—Affair at Harmoza.—The Carrion passed.—Excesses
at Torquemada.—Affairs of the Pisuerga and Villa Muriel.—Retreat.—Affair
at Huebra.—A British division endangered.—Irregularities
of the army produce a strong official rebuke.—Lord Wellington’s
honours increased.—Army goes into cantonments for the winter.</p></blockquote>

<p>A retreat was unavoidable; and, to be successful, it must be
rapid. Two roads were open; and by either Lord Wellington
might fall back. The longer of the two was by the bridge
of Villaton—and by taking it the allies would be safe from
present interruption. The other crossed the river of Arlanzan
at Burgos—and by following that the retreat would be shortened
by a day’s march—but to gain that road, the army must
defile directly beneath the guns of the castle.</p>

<p>By this latter route, however, Wellington determined to
retire—and the strictest secrecy was observed, while all was
prepared for a night-march. When darkness had shrouded
the besiegers and the besieged, the position was quietly abandoned;
the infantry defiled across the bridge in perfect silence—while
the wheels of the gun-carriages were muffled with
straw, to prevent their being overheard by the French sentinels,
and thus provoke a fire from the place.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt that this dangerous passage would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
been accomplished without discovery, had not some guerilla
horsemen rashly galloped over, and betrayed to the garrison
the movement of the allies then in progress. In anticipation
of the attempt, the guns of the works having been already
trained upon the bridge, the first discharge from the French
artillery was destructive; but the range was lost after a round
or two, and in the darkness it could not be recovered. By this
bold and well-planned manœuvre, Lord Wellington extricated
his entire baggage and field equipage; and the allies were
placed on the other side of the Arlanzan, and in the direct line
of their retreat, with a loss comparatively trifling.</p>

<p>That night, the infantry reached Hormillas and Cellada del
Camino, and the cavalry, Estepar and Villa Baniel—while
Souham remained in perfect ignorance of Wellington’s retreat,
until late on the evening of the 22nd.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, the infantry, after a long march, crossed the
Pisuerga at Cordovillas and Torquemada; but the rear-guard
were overtaken and attacked. Although greatly overmatched,
the British cavalry made a bold stand, and for a time disputed
the passage of the Harmoza. But they were obliged to retire
as fresh squadrons of the enemy moved rapidly forward.</p>

<p>Part of the English dragoons crossed by a marshy rivulet,
leaving Anson’s cavalry and the German light infantry as a
rear-guard. The French came on with great impetuosity, and
were charged and checked by the 11th light dragoons and horse
artillery; but their numbers prevailed—the English were
forced back—the guerilla horse completely routed—and some
prisoners made. After much severe and desultory fighting, in
which the fierceness of the pursuers was fully equalled by the
obstinate resistance of the retreating horsemen, the British
cavalry were driven back upon the Germans, under Halket.
Fortunately the latter had gained a position—and assisted by
the fire of the artillery, their fusilade fell on the left flank of
the French with such murderous effect, that, failing in three
determined charges, they were at last forced to fall back behind
the heights, allowing the British rear-guard, without further
molestation, to retire.</p>

<p>Wellington having crossed the Carrion on the 24th, was
joined by a brigade of the Guards. The weather was bad, the
means of transport wretched, the sick and wounded were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
beyond the Duero, and thus circumstanced, the allied commander
determined to make a stand. The allies, therefore,
occupied a range of heights, with the Carrion in their front, and
their right wing resting on the Pisuerga.</p>

<p>Torquemada had witnessed a most disgraceful scene of riot
and confusion on the part of the British. There, immense
wine-stores were found and plundered—and it was computed
that at one time, twelve thousand men were lying in the streets
and houses in a state of helpless intoxication. Nor was the
boasted sobriety of the French proof against the temptation
these well-stored cellars presented. On their subsequent occupation
of the town, Souham was obliged to stay his march
for twelve hours,—for his own corps numbered more
drunkards even than that of Lord Wellington had done.</p>

<p>The 25th was given as a halt-day to the troops—while
necessary preparations were made for continuing the retreat,
and interrupting the passage of the Carrion. All the bridges
were ordered to be blown up—but the mines were in some
cases so defective, that they failed entirely, and allowed the
French an easy passage, while others of their troops crossed by
the fords.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> The working and covering parties at Banos and
Palentia were made prisoners, and a quantity of baggage picked
up by the enemy’s light cavalry. At Pisuerga, the corps
that Souham pushed forward was attacked and driven back;
and at Villa Muriel, after a sharp contest, the enemy were
obliged to retire, and abandon the bank of the river that they
had succeeded in occupying for a time.</p>

<p>On the 26th, having repaired the bridges, Souham crossed
the Carrion in pursuit of the allies. On the 27th he was in force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
in front of Cabezon, and showed himself in such strength as
determined Lord Wellington at once to fall back behind the
Duero, and still further behind the Tormes, in the event of
his being more closely pressed by the enemy. On the 28th,
the French general extended his right to outflank the allies,
and advanced against the troops who held the passes over the
Pisguera and the Duero. Unable to maintain the bridges,
they were effectually destroyed; and a town and wood, behind
that of Tordesillas, were occupied by the regiment of Brunswick
Oels, until the Germans were driven from both by the
French, who effected the passage of the Duero with uncommon
gallantry.</p>

<p>On the 29th, Wellington, after destroying the bridges at
Valladolid and Cabezon, passed the river by those of Tudela
and Ponte Duero. The passage of the French at Tordesillas
obliged him instantly to move to his left, and take a position
near Rueda—and there he remained, until joined by Sir Rowland
Hill upon the 5th of November—who, after leaving a
corps in Alba de Tormes, had fallen back before Joseph Buonaparte
and Marshal Soult, with scarcely any loss. Wellington,
having effected this object, and united himself with his
detached corps, retired on the 7th to Torricilla,—and on the
8th halted in front of Salamanca.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the armies of the north, south, and centre, had
formed a junction on the right bank of the Tormes—and on
the 10th, they attacked the town and castle of Alba, but
without success. Passing the Tormes, at Lucinas, on the
14th, Soult, who commanded in chief, took a position on the
wooded heights of Mozarbes. That evening the hostile armies
were in each other’s presence; a distant cannonade and some
trifling skirmishing took place; and, on the 15th, Lord Wellington
formed beside the Arapiles and offered battle, which
was declined. The enemy extended to the right, threatening
to interrupt the communications with Rodrigo—and from
the immense disparity of his force,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> Wellington was obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
to move promptly by his right, and seize the roads leading
into Portugal.</p>

<p>The weather was desperate—rain fell in torrents—the roads
were rendered almost impassable—the men were knee-deep in
the sloughs—and the transport of the guns and baggage had
become a work of infinite difficulty. The imposing steadiness
with which the British rear-guard retired before the French
advance, checked any attempt that Soult might have entertained
of pressing the retreat so closely as to bring Lord
Wellington to action, and especially on ground that he himself
would not select, on which to make a stand. Ciudad Rodrigo
was gained on the 18th, and the frontier crossed upon the 20th.
The 17th had passed in continued demonstrations of attack,
and frequent skirmishes. Not daring to assail the columns,
every advantage that a wooded country would permit, was
seized upon to cut off stragglers and secure baggage. In
many attempts on both, the enemy were successful; and
a British general of division, Sir Edward Paget, was carried
off while literally in the centre of his own brigades.</p>

<p>The main body of the allies had already crossed the
Huebra, when the French infantry and artillery came up in
force, and obliged the cavalry to cross the fords—and a delay
in retiring the light division from the position they had been
placed in on the edge of the forest, brought on a sharp affair.
The British, however, effected the passage of the river with
inconsiderable loss—and every effort the French made to carry
the fords failed owing to the steadiness with which they were
defended. The firing was kept up till dark—and although
the light and seventh divisions were exposed in column to a
plunging fire from thirty guns, their loss was miraculously
small, as “this clayey soil, saturated with rain, swallowed the
shot and smothered the shells.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>On the 18th, the retreat was continued—Lord Wellington
having given the necessary directions as to the line of march
which the different divisions of his army should pursue—his
orders were disobeyed—and serious results had nearly been
occasioned. Happily, his lordship discovered the irregularity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
of his subordinate officers in time to avert disastrous consequences.
The retreating brigades were completely arrested by
a flooded river—and with great difficulty were extricated,
from what would have been, very shortly, a desperate and
hopeless position. Indeed, so critically were they situated,
that the light division, composing the rear-guard, were obliged
to cross a gulley by single files, effecting the passage by means
of a fallen tree.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>Here the retreat virtually closed. The weather improved;
and having fallen back upon his resources, Lord Wellington
was enabled to recruit his exhausted soldiery. Abundant
fuel, dry bivouacs, and plentiful rations, produced a speedy
change; and men wearied and worn down by privations and
incessant fatigue, rapidly recovered their health and spirits.
The moment the enemy had abandoned the pursuit, the
light cavalry and guerilla horse were despatched to scour the
woods, and rescue such sufferers as survived. Their efforts
were attended with success—and more than fifteen hundred
wounded or disabled men were brought into the hospitals and
saved.</p>

<p>The total casualties sustained by the troops during the
siege and subsequent retreat of Burgos, were very numerous—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
in no point are military writers and official returns
more at variance, than in the respective estimates they form
of the losses of the allies. Where such immense discrepancy
exists, it is hard to come to any thing like an accurate conclusion.
The French asserted that the allies lost twelve thousand
men, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>; the English reduced it to little
more than twelve hundred. Between these extremes, the
mean is more likely to prove correct; and there can be little
doubt, all casualties included, that in the siege and subsequent
operations to the 29th of October, seven thousand men were
sacrificed.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
The retreat from Burgos was not only remarkable for the
sufferings they endured, but also for the insubordination
exhibited by the soldiery. The mass of the army became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
drunkards and marauders. The wine-stores in the towns and
villages on the line of march were broken into and despoiled
of their contents; and multitudes, through inebriety, either
perished or were made prisoners. In Valderoso alone, two
hundred and fifty men were left drunk in the cellars—and, of
course, they fell into the hands of the French. Drunkenness
produced cruelty—and many of the peasantry hitherto well
affected to the allies,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> perished by the hands of infuriated
savages, who seemed reckless whether friend or foe became
the victim of their ferocity. Napier says, that on the first
day’s march from Madrid, he reckoned seventeen murdered
peasants, either lying on the road or thrown into the
ditches.</p>

<p>Another mischievous breach of discipline had become very
general. Numerous herds of swine were found among the
woods—and the soldiers broke from their columns, and commenced
shooting pigs wherever they could be found. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
spattering fire kept up in the forest by these marauders, frequently
occasioned an unnecessary alarm, and thus disturbed
the brief space allowed for rest to the exhausted soldiers.
Nothing but the greatest severity checked this most dangerous
offence—and though some of the delinquents, when taken
“red-handed” and in the very fact, were hanged in the sight
of their guilty comrades, the evil was but partially abated by
the example; for hunger had made the starving soldiery indifferent
to the desperate consequences their offending was certain
to draw down.</p>

<p>The excesses committed during the retreat, drew from Lord
Wellington an official letter, addressed to the commanding
officers of regiments, that occasioned at the time considerable
dissatisfaction.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> Probably, the terms in which his censure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
was conveyed, were stronger than they should have been.
The sufferings of the troops were great beyond belief—men
marching night and day, under an incessant deluge, knee-deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
in mire, without shelter or a place to rest upon, their whole
sustenance a scanty ration of over-driven beef, frequently
devoured half-raw—all these should have been well considered—and
while the soldiery could not be justified in acts of violence
and rapine, still they might urge much in extenuation
of crimes committed under the influence of want, misery and
despair!<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>Honours, in the mean time, were conferred upon the able,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
but unsuccessful besieger of Burgos. At home, Lord Wellington
was advanced to a Marquisate in the peerage, while
Parliament added 100,000<i>l.</i> to assist him to support this dignity.
He was also appointed to the Colonelcy of the Blues—while
the rank of Duke of Vitoria was conferred upon him
by the Prince Regent of Portugal, with emoluments attached
to it valued at 15,000 dollars annually. The honour bestowed
upon him the Marquis of Wellington accepted—but the income,
with becoming dignity, he respectfully declined.</p>

<p>After the French retired behind the Tormes, the allies took
up their winter cantonments. Hill passed the Sierra de Gata,
and established his corps in the province of Coria, with posts
at the passes of Bejar and Banos. The remaining divisions
were comfortably disposed of—part of the brigades occupying
quarters in the district of Beira, while the others were cantoned
upon the banks of the Douro.</p>

<p>Winter passed away—the army recovered from its hardships—and
Lord Wellington was indefatigable in perfecting
the equipment of every department, to enable him to take
the field efficiently when the season should come round,
and active operations could be again renewed. In its minuter
details, the interior economy of the regiments underwent
a useful reformation. The large and cumbrous camp-kettles
hitherto in use, were discarded, and small ones substituted
in their place; while three tents were served to each
company, affording, particularly to the sick and disabled, a
means of shelter in the field which hitherto had been wanting.</p>

<p>Nothing could surpass the splendid state of discipline that
this period of inactivity had produced, while the allied army
was reposing in winter quarters. Its <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> was now truly
magnificent; powerful reinforcements having arrived from
England. The Life and Horse Guards had joined the cavalry;
and that arm, hitherto the weakest, was increased to
nineteen efficient regiments. The infantry had been recruited
from the militias at home—the artillery was complete in every
requisite for the field—while a well-arranged commissariate,
with ample means of transport, facilitated the operations of the
most serviceable force which had ever taken the field under
the leading of an English general.</p>

<p>Previous to the opening of the campaign in May, 1813, the
Anglo-Portuguese army numbered close upon seventy thousand
men of all arms, and were cantoned in the neighbourhood
of the Douro. Morillo’s corps occupied Estremadura; Giron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
held the frontier of Gallicia; O’Donel was stationed in Andalusia;
Elio on the frontiers of Murcia and Valencia; and the
Duc del Parque, with a strong corps, held possession of La
Mancha.</p>

<p>The French, at that time, might have probably mustered
one hundred and fifty thousand men in Spain. Madrid and
Toledo were in the occupation of the armies of the centre and
the south, whose corps were spread over the central provinces.
Valladolid had the head-quarters of the army of Portugal;
the line of the Douro was carefully observed, while Suchet
occupied Valencia and Catalonia; and a part of the army of
the north was quartered in Aragon and Biscay.</p>

<p>Never did a leader take the field under more promising auspices,
than those with which the allied commander opened the
campaign of 1813. The Spanish troops were strong in
numbers, and considerably improved in discipline; while the
guerilla leaders were in great force, and ready for daring enterprise.
Summer was coming fast—a rich and luxurious
country was before him,—every requisite prepared for his
march; his troops flushed with victory; and his opponents
dispirited by constant discomfiture. Even the opening movements
tended to increase these feelings—for the British were
preparing to advance, and the French already retrograding.
No wonder, then, that the brilliant hopes of a country were
fully realized; that the career of English conquest continued
almost without a check; and the fields of France saw her banners
float in victory, until the last struggles at Orthes and
Toulouse, attested the invincibility of Wellington and his
island soldiery!</p>

<p>While the allies were preparing to march, Joseph Buonaparte
put the army of the centre into motion, and, followed
by those of the south and Portugal, retired slowly on the Ebro.
As they were not pressed by the British light troops, the
enemy’s corps moved leisurely towards the frontier, accompanied
by enormous trains of equipage and baggage.</p>

<p>The appearance of the French army was more picturesque
than military. It was crowded in its march, and too fanciful
both in the character of its equipment and the variety of its
costume. The line and light infantry excepted, few of the
regiments were similarly dressed. The horse artillery wore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
uniforms of light blue, braided with black lace. The heavy
cavalry were arrayed in green coats with brass helmets. The
chasseurs and hussars, mounted on slight and active horses,
were showily and variously equipped. The “gendarmerie à cheval,”
a picked body chosen from the cavalry at large, had long
blue frocks, with cocked hats and buff belts; while the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of
the dragoons, selected for superior size and general appearance,
were distinguished by bear-skin caps, and wore a look of martial
determination, that their past and future bearing in the
battle-field did not belie. Each regiment of the line had its
company of grenadiers and voltigeurs—even the light regiments
having a company of the former. The appearance of
the whole force was soldierly and imposing—the cavalry was
indeed superb—and the artillery, as to guns, caissons, and
appointments, most complete; and, better still, their horses
were in excellent condition.</p>

<p>Both armies were in the highest state of efficiency—for to
both the undivided attention of their commanding officers had
been directed—and yet in their respective equipments, a
practised eye would detect a marked dissimilarity. With the
British every thing was simple, compact, and limited, as far as
its being serviceable would admit,—while the French were
sadly incumbered with useless equipages and accumulated
plunder. Those of the Spanish noblesse who had acknowledged
the usurper, now accompanied his retreat,—state functionaries,
in court-dresses and rich embroidery, were mingled with the
troops,—calashes, carrying wives or mistresses, moved between
brigades of guns; while nuns from Castile and ladies from
Andalusia, attired <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en militaire</i> and mounted on horseback,
deserted castle and convent, to follow the fortunes of some
soldier or employé. Excepting that of his great brother
when retreating from Moscow, no army since the days of
Xerxes, was so overloaded with spoil and baggage as that of
Joseph Buonaparte.</p>

<p>Although this abuse had not escaped the observation of
many of the best officers in the army of the usurper, the facility
with which these enormous ambulances were transported encouraged
rather than repressed the evil. Looking on Spain
as a conquered country, the means necessary to forward their
convoys were unscrupulously seized—and every horse and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
mule was considered the property of the finder. The roads
were good—the retreat unmolested—on the 10th, no enemy
had appeared—and the allies were remaining quietly in their
quarters. The fancied apathy of the English general was
extraordinary—and prisoners were asked by their French
escort, “Was Lord Wellington asleep?”</p>

<p>But nothing could exceed the astonishment of Joseph,
when, on the evening of the 18th, he was informed that the
allies in considerable force, were actually on the left bank of the
Ebro! The French dispositions were rendered useless, and
an immediate night-march became unavoidable. The drums
beat to arms—the baggage was put in motion—and the entire
of the French corps which had occupied Pancorbo or bivouacked
in its vicinity, were hastily collected, and moved rapidly
towards Vitoria.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington’s sudden advance was equally brilliant in
conception and execution. While he had thrown five divisions
over the Douro, to move through the Tras as Montes, upon
Zamora, Hill was marching over the mountain district of
Estremadura on the Tormes, and Lord Wellington on Salamanca,
with two Anglo-Portuguese, a Spanish division, and a
strong cavalry corps. The right wing of the allies took a
position between the Tormes and the Douro—while Sir
Thomas Graham, with the left, passed over a most difficult
country, and surmounting every obstacle that bad roads and
dangerous rivers could present, threatened the right of the
French by Carvajales and Miranda.</p>

<p>On gaining the frontier, Graham secured his communication
with the Gallician corps under Giron. The French retired,
from the Esla, and the left wing of the British crossed it on the
31st of May. A difficult and defensible river was thus safely
passed—and the enemy retreated, after blowing up the bridges
of Zamora and Toro. At Morales, the French rear-guard,
was overtaken and brought to action. Colonel Grant, with
the hussar brigade, completely overthrew it,—killing a considerable
number and capturing above two hundred men.
Julian Sanchez was equally successful—he having surprised
a French picket at Castronuno.</p>

<p>No movements executed during the Peninsular campaign
exceeded in brilliant effect the rapid advance of the allied army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
from the Douro to the Bayas. Joseph had been obliged to
abandon the capital, and fall back on Burgos. This was a
necessary measure to ensure a concentration of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps
d’armée</i>,—but still, it was considered doubtful whether Lord
Wellington would continue his onward march, and under all
circumstances, actually become assailant.</p>

<p>But the French leaders were astray when they fancied that
the allied general would remain inactive. Quickly as the
Douro had been crossed, the Carrion and the Pisuerga were
as rapidly passed over. The enemy fell back on Burgos to
concentrate, having occupied the heights above Harmoza with
a strong corps. On the 12th, Hill’s division and the cavalry
obliged Count Reille to fall back—and on the next morning
the French retreated on Miranda, after abandoning Burgos
and blowing up the castle.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p>“It can hardly be imagined what additional interest even
a brilliant operation will acquire from local circumstances, and
the character of the country through which the line of march
runs. The advance to the Zadorra exhibited, at every point
of view, scenery beautiful as diversified. In it there was a
singular combination of romantic wildness mingled with exquisite
fertility. One while the columns moved through luxurious
valleys, intersprinkled with hamlets, vineyards, and
flower-gardens; at another, they struggled up mountain ridges,
or pressed through alpine passes overhung with topping cliffs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
making it almost difficult to decide, whether the rugged chasm
which they were traversing had been rifted from the hill-side
by an earthquake, or scarped by human hands. If the eye
turned downwards, there lay sparkling rivers and sunny dells;
above rose naked rocks and splintered precipices; while moving
masses of glittering soldiery, now lost, now seen, amid the
windings of the route, gave a panoramic character to the
whole, that never can fade from the memory of him who
saw it.”<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>Pancorbo had been regularly garrisoned; and to force the
Ebro, with a numerous and efficient army occupying its banks,
would have been equally tedious in operation, and uncertain
in results. Wellington, with admirable skill, suddenly
branched to his left, and moved rapidly towards the sources
of the river; and, on the 14th and 15th, crossed it safely by
the mountain bridges of San Martin and Puente de Arenas.
Of course, the march, from the nearly impassable character of
the line of country over which it ran, required the determination
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i> of British soldiers to accomplish. It was
gallantly achieved; and that too, by a route hitherto unattempted
by an army, and which every where presented the
most formidable positions that a retreating corps could wish to
hold. Yet Wellington’s march was unopposed,—and until
the 18th, no hostile collision interrupted the order of the
allied movements.</p>

<p>Two French brigades were overtaken by the light division.
They had taken a position on the heights of Saint Milan;
and although the ground was most unfavourable for an attack,
nothing could surpass the dashing gallantry with which the
British light troops assailed the enemy. The road by which
it was necessary to attack, was rugged, steep, and narrow,
overhung with crags and copse-wood; while a mountain
stream protected the French front, and some straggling
cottages increased the difficulty of advancing, by affording
good cover to the voltigeurs formed behind them. After a
sharp fusilade, the enemy gave ground, and the light brigade
was pressing forward, when suddenly, a fresh column
debouched from a ravine, and appeared on the flank of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
assailants. Both rushed on to gain the crest of the hill—and
both reached the plateau together. The 52nd, bringing their
left flank forward in a run, faced sharply round, and charged
with the bayonet. The conflict was but momentary; the
French broke, threw away their knapsacks, and fled to
gain the neighbouring high grounds, leaving their arms and
baggage, and nearly three hundred of their number <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de
combat</i>.</p>

<p>On the same day, Jourdan suddenly attacked Graham’s
corps at Osma, but he was driven back on Espejo; and falling
farther back, the French took up a strong position behind the
Bayas, with their right on the village of Sabijana; but they
held it only till next day,—when being attacked in front, and
their left turned, they fell back and united the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i>
in front of Vitoria.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<p>That city, on the evening of 19th, displayed a singular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
spectacle of hurry and alarm—confusion and magnificence.
Joseph Buonaparte, with his staff and guards, the entire of
his court, and the head-quarters of the army of the centre,
accompanied by an endless collection of equipages, intermingled
with cavalry, artillery, and their numerous ambulances,
occupied the buildings and crowded the streets—while an
unmanageable mass of soldiers and civilians were every moment
increased by fresh arrivals, all vainly seeking for accommodation
in a town unequal to afford shelter to half their
number.</p>

<p>“But a yet stranger scene was enacting in Vitoria. While
the city was brilliantly illuminated in honour of the pseudo-king,—and
a gayer sight could not be fancied than its sparkling
interior presented;—beyond the walls, an army was
taking a position, and a multitude of the peasants, forced by the
French engineers, were employed in throwing up field defences,
and assisting those who had ruled them with an iron hand to
place their guns in battery, and make other military dispositions
to repel the army of the allies, who were advancing to
effect their deliverance.”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<h2 id="chap_34">VITORIA.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">City of Vitoria.—French position.—Opening, progress, and close of the
engagement.—Field of battle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vitoria is a city of great antiquity, and the capital of the
province of Alava. It stands in a valley surrounded on every
side by high grounds, while in the distance a lesser range of
the Pyrenees is visible. Its name is derived from some
forgotten victory, or, as some assert, from one achieved by its
founder, Sancho VII. In front of this city<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> Joseph
Buonaparte concentrated his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> on the night of
the 19th, to cover the town, and hold the three great
roads leading from Lagrona, Madrid, and Bilboa, to Bayonne.</p>

<p>The day of the 20th was occupied by Lord Wellington in
bringing forward his detached brigades, and making a careful
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i> of the enemy. Although, generally, the position
selected by Marshal Jourdan was strong, and certainly
well chosen to effect the objects for which he risked a battle,
still it had one material defect. Its great extent would permit
many simultaneous efforts to be made by an attacking army;
and accordingly on the following day, the allied leader, with
admirable skill, availed himself of this advantage—and a most
decisive victory was the result.</p>

<p>In point of strength, the contending armies were nearly
equal, each numbering from seventy to seventy-five thousand
men, the allies exceeding the French, probably by five thousand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
Perfect in every arm, more splendid troops were never
ranged upon a battle-field. Both armies were ably commanded,—nominally,
Joseph was général-en-chef—but Jourdan
chose the ground, and directed every disposition.</p>

<p>The morning of the 21st broke in glorious sunshine. The
atmosphere was cloudless—and from the adjacent heights the
progress of the battle could be distinctly viewed, except when
smoke-wreaths for a time hid the combatants from many an
anxious looker-on.</p>

<p>The French corps occupied a line of nearly eight miles,—the
extreme left placed upon the heights of La Puebla, and the
right resting on an eminence above the villages of Abechuco
and Gamarra Mayor. The centre was posted along a range
of hills on the left bank of the river; while a strong corps,
resting its right flank upon the left centre, was formed on the
bold high grounds which rise behind the village of Sabijana.
The reserve was placed at the village of Gomecha; and the
banks of the Zadorra, and a small wood between the centre
and the right, were thickly lined with tirailleurs. The first
line consisted of the armies of Portugal and the south; and
the army of the centre, with the greater portion of the cavalry,
formed the reserve. That part of the position near the village
of Gomecha, having been considered by Jourdan his most
vulnerable point, was defended by a numerous artillery. The
bridges were fortified—the communications from one part of
the position to the other were direct—a deep river ran in
front—the great roads to Bayonne and Pamplona in the rear—while,
to arrest Wellington’s career, and preserve the
immense convoys within the city, or on the road to France,
loaded with the plunder of a despoiled capital and a denuded
country, the pseudo-king determined to accept the battle, which
the British leader was now prepared to deliver.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>During the Peninsular campaigns, there was no battle
fought that required nicer combinations, and a more correct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
calculation in time and movement, than that of Vitoria. It
was impossible for Lord Wellington to bring up, to an immediate
proximity for attack, every portion of his numerous
army, and hence many of his brigades had bivouacked on the
preceding night a considerable distance from the Zadorra.
Part of the country before Vitoria was difficult and rocky;
and hamlets, enclosures, and ravines, separated the columns
from each other; hence some of them were obliged to move
by narrow and broken roads—and arrangements, perfect in
themselves, were liable to embarrassment from numerous
contingencies. But the genius that directed these extended
operations, could remedy fortuitous events, should such
occur.</p>

<p>At daybreak, on the 21st, Wellington’s dispositions were
complete, and the allied army in motion. Sir Rowland Hill,
with the second British, Amarante’s Portuguese, and
Morillo’s<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> Spanish divisions, was ordered to storm the heights
of La Puebla, occupied by the enemy’s left. The first and
fifth divisions, with Pack’s and Bradford’s brigades, Bock’s
and Anson’s cavalry, and Longa’s Spanish corps, were directed
to turn the French right, cross the Zadorra, and seize on the
Bayonne road. The third, fourth, seventh, and light divisions,
were to advance in two columns and attack Vitoria in
front and flank, and thus oblige Jourdan either to come to a
general engagement, or abandon the city and sacrifice his
valuable convoys.</p>

<p>At dawn of day, Joseph placed himself upon a height that
overlooked his right and centre. He was attended by a numerous
staff, and protected by his own body-guard. Wellington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
chose an eminence in front of the village of Arinez, commanding
the right bank of the Zadorra, and continued there,
observing through a glass the progress of the fight, and directing
the movements of his divisions, as calmly as he would
have inspected their movements at a review.</p>

<p>The attack commenced by Hill’s division moving soon after
daylight by the Miranda road, and the detaching of Morillo’s
Spanish corps to carry the heights of La Puebla, and drive in
the left flank of the enemy. The latter task was a difficult
one, as the ground rose abruptly from the valley, and towering
to a considerable height, presented a sheer ascent, that at first
sight appeared almost impracticable.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, with great difficulty, although unopposed,
reached the summit; and there, among rocks and broken
ground, became sharply engaged with the French left. Perceiving
that they were unable to force the enemy from the
heights, Sir Rowland Hill advanced a British brigade to Morillo’s
assistance; while, alarmed for the safety of his flank,
Jourdan detached troops from his centre to support the division
that held La Puebla. A fierce and protracted combat
ensued—the loss on both sides was severe—and Colonel Cadogan
fell at the head of his brigade. But gradually and
steadily the British gained ground; and while the eyes of both
armies were turned upon the combatants and the possession of
the heights seemed doubtful still, the eagle glance of Wellington
discovered the forward movement of the Highland
tartans, and he announced to his staff, that La Puebla was
carried.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>The village of Sabijana was the next object of attack—and
a brigade of the second division stormed it after a short but determined
resistance. As that village covered the left of their
line, the French made many efforts to recover its possession; but
it was most gallantly retained until the left and centre of the
allies moved up, and the attack on the enemy’s line became
general.</p>

<p>While Sabijana was repeatedly assaulted, the light division
was formed in close columns under cover of some broken
ground, and at a short distance from the river. The hussar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
brigade, dismounted, were on the left; and the fourth division
in position on the right, waiting the signal for advancing. The
heavy cavalry formed a reserve to the centre, in event of its
requiring support before the third and seventh divisions had
come up; and the first and fifth, with a Spanish and Portuguese
corps, were detached to occupy the road to San Sebastian,
and thus intercept the enemy’s retreat.</p>

<p>Presently, an opening cannonade upon the left announced
that Sir Thomas Graham was engaged, and Lord Dalhousie
notified his arrival with the third and seventh divisions at
Mendonza. The moment for a grand movement had come—Lord
Wellington saw and seized the crisis of the day, and
ordered a general attack on the whole extent of the French
position.</p>

<p>The light division moved forward under cover of a thicket,
and placed itself opposite the enemy’s right centre, about two
hundred paces from the bridge of Villoses—and on the arrival
of Lord Dalhousie, the signal was given to advance. At this
critical moment an intelligent Spaniard opportunely came up,
and announced that one of the bridges was undefended. The
mistake was quickly seized upon. A brigade, led by the first
rifles, crossed it at a run—and, without any loss, established
itself in a deep ravine, where it was completely protected from
the enemy’s cannonade.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more beautiful than the operations which
followed. The light division carried the bridge of Nanclaus,
and the fourth that of Tres Puentes; the divisions of Picton
and Dalhousie followed, and the battle became general. The
passage of the river—the movement of glittering masses
from right to left, far as the eye could range—the deafening
roar of cannon—the sustained fusilade of infantry—all was
grand and imposing; while the English cavalry, displayed in
glorious sunshine and formed in line to support the columns,
completed a spectacle, grand and magnificent beyond description.</p>

<p>Immediately after crossing the Zadorra, Colville’s brigade
became seriously engaged with a strong French corps, and
gallantly defeated it. Pressing on with characteristic impetuosity,
and without halting to correct the irregularity a recent
and successful struggle had occasioned, the brigade encountered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
on the brow of the hill, two lines of French infantry regularly
drawn up, and prepared to receive their assailants. For a
moment the result was regarded with considerable apprehension,
and means actually adopted for sustaining the brigade,
when—as that event seemed inevitable—it should be repulsed
by the enemy. But valour overcame every disadvantage, and
the perfect formation of the French could not withstand the
dashing onset of the assailants. Their rush was irresistible—on
went these daring soldiers, “sweeping before them the formidable
array that, circumstanced as they were, appeared calculated
to produce annihilation.”</p>

<p>While the combined movements of the different divisions
were thus in every place successful, the attack on the village
of Arinez failed, and the 88th were repulsed in an attempt to
storm it. Here, the French fought desperately—and here
alone, the fortune of the day wavered for a moment. Nothing
could exceed the obstinacy with which the village was defended;
but, under a severe fire, Lord Wellington in person
directed a fresh assault. The 45th and 74th ascended the
height; the French were fairly forced out at the point of
the bayonet, and Arinez, after a sanguinary struggle, was won.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the flank movements on Gamarra Mayor and
Abechuco were effected with splendid success. Both villages,
having bridges across the river, were filled with troops and
vigorously defended. Gamarra Mayor was stormed with the
bayonet by Oswald’s division without firing a shot; and, under
cover of the artillery, Halket’s German light infantry, and
Bradford’s Portuguese caçadores, advanced against Abechuco.
Nothing could be more gallant than their assault—the French
were dislodged from the village with heavy loss, and the
bridges left in the undisputed possession of the victors.</p>

<p>The whole of the enemy’s first line were now driven back,
but they retired in perfect order, and re-forming close to Vitoria,
presented an imposing front, protected by nearly one
hundred pieces of artillery. A tremendous fire checked the
advance of the left centre; and the storm of the guns on both
sides raged with unabated fury for an hour. Vitoria, although
so near the combatants, was hidden from view by the dense
smoke—while volley after volley from the French infantry
thinned, though it could not shake, Picton’s “fighting third.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
It was a desperate and final effort. The allies were advancing
in beautiful order; while confusion was already visible
in the enemy’s ranks, as their left attempted to retire by eschelons
of divisions—a dangerous movement when badly executed.
Presently the cannon were abandoned, and the whole mass of
French troops commenced a most disorderly retreat by the
road to Pamplona.</p>

<p>“The sun was setting, and his last rays fell upon a magnificent
spectacle. Red masses of infantry were seen advancing
steadily across the plain—the horse-artillery at a gallop to the
front, to open its fire on the fugitives—the hussar brigade
charging by the Camino Real—while the second division,
having overcome every obstacle, and driven the enemy from
its front, was extending over the heights upon the right in line,
its arms and appointments flashing gloriously, in the fading
sunshine of ‘departing day.’”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>Never had an action been more general, nor the attacks on
every part of an extended position more simultaneous and successful.
In the line of operations six bridges over the Zadorra
were crossed or stormed—that on the road to Burgos enabled
Lord Hill to pass; the fourth division crossed that of Nanclares;
the light, at Tres Puentes; Picton and Dalhousie passed
the river lower down; while Lord Lynedoch carried Abechuco
and Gamarra Mayor, though both were strongly fortified, and
both obstinately defended.</p>

<p>Driven completely through Vitoria, the French never made
an attempt to rally. The formation of their army was totally
destroyed, and its disorganization completed. Indeed, no
defeat could have been more decisive—the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i> was general;
and an army, at sunrise perfect in every arm, had become at
evening a mixed and helpless mob. Even at Ocana and Medellin,
the raw, undisciplined, and ill-commanded Spaniards
had never been more completely routed. Very few of the
infantry retained their muskets,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> and many threw away their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
whole accoutrements in order to expedite their flight. All
were abandoned to the conquerors—and the travelling carriage
of the pseudo-king, with his wardrobe, plate, wines, and private
correspondence, were found among the spoils. Indeed,
Joseph himself narrowly escaped from being added to the list;
for Captain Wyndham made a bold dash at “The Intruder,”
with a squadron of the 10th hussars, and firing into the coach,
obliged him to leave it, and ride off at speed under the protection
of a strong escort of cavalry.</p>

<p>Night closed upon the victors and the vanquished—and
darkness and broken ground favoured the escape of battalions
flying from the field in mob-like disorder, and incapable of
any resistance, had they been overtaken and attacked. Two
leagues from Vitoria, however, the pursuit was reluctantly
given up,—but the horse-artillery, while a shot could reach
the fugitives, continued to harass the retreat.</p>

<p>The whole baggage and field equipage of three distinct
armies fell, on this occasion, into the hands of the conquerors.
One hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, four hundred caissons,
twelve thousand rounds of ammunition, and two millions of
musket-cartridges, with a thousand prisoners, were taken.
The casualties on both sides were heavy. The British lost
five hundred killed, two thousand eight hundred wounded;
the Portuguese one hundred and fifty killed, nine hundred
wounded; and the Spaniards eighty-nine of the former, and
four hundred and sixty of the latter. The French loss, of
course, was infinitely greater; and even by their own returns
it was admitted to amount to eight thousand; but, prisoners
included, it must have exceeded that number considerably.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
On the morning of the 22nd, the field of battle, and the
roads for some miles in the rear, exhibited an appearance it
seldom falls within human fortune to witness. There, lay the
wreck of a mighty army; while plunder, accumulated during
the French successes, and wrung from every part of Spain
with unsparing rapacity, was recklessly abandoned to any who
chose to seize it. Cannon and caissons, carriages and tumbrels,
waggons of every description, were overturned or deserted—and
a stranger <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mélange</i> could not be imagined, than that
which these enormous convoys presented to the eye. Here,
was the personal baggage of a king; there, the scenery and
decorations of a theatre. Munitions of war were mixed with
articles of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">virtù</i>—and scattered arms and packs, silks, embroidery,
plate, and jewels, mingled together in wild disorder. One
waggon was loaded with money, another with cartridges—while
wounded soldiers, deserted women, and children of every age,
every where implored assistance, or threw themselves for protection
on the humanity of the victors. Here, a lady was overtaken
in her carriage—in the next calash was an actress or
fille-de-chambre,—while droves of oxen were roaming over
the plain, intermingled with an endless quantity of sheep and
goats, mules and horses, asses and cows.</p>

<p>That much valuable plunder came into the hands of the
soldiery is certain; but the better portion fell to the peasantry
and camp-followers. Two valuable captures were secured—a
full military chest, and the baton<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> of Marshal Jourdan.</p>

<p>Were not the indiscriminating system of spoliation pursued
by the French armies recollected, the enormous collection of
plunder abandoned at Vitoria would appear incredible. From
the highest to the lowest, all were bearing off some valuables
from the country they had overrun; and even the king himself
had not proved an exception—for, rolled in the imperials of
his own coach, some of the finest pictures from the royal galleries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
were discovered. To secure or facilitate their transport,
they had been removed from their frames, and deposited in the
royal carriage, no doubt, destined to add to the unrivalled
collection, that by similar means had been abstracted from the
Continent, and presented to the Louvre. Wellington, however,
interrupted the Spanish paintings in their transit—and
thus saved the trouble and formality of a restoration.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<h2 id="chap_35">BATTLES OF THE PYRENEES.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Joseph Buonaparte retreats into France.—Pamplona blockaded, and San
Sebastian besieged.—Battles of the Pyrenees.</p></blockquote>

<p>The disordered state in which the French army appeared
before the gates of Pamplona, rendered it advisable to forbid
them entrance, and their retreat was necessarily continued.
Graham, with the left corps of the allies, had endeavoured to
cut off Foy; but, though he failed in effecting it, he forced
him, after abandoning Tolosa, to cross the frontier. Hill’s
corps followed the French on the Pamplona road; and another
part of his army was detached by Lord Wellington against
Clausel by Logrono, while a second corps moved rapidly on
Tudela to interrupt his retreat. By marching on Zaragossa,
Clausel retired into France by the pass of Jaca; but, in this
hasty operation, he lost all his artillery, and was obliged to
abandon a redoubt with its garrison, which some time afterwards
fell into Mina’s hands. Pancorba surrendered to
O’Donel, and Passages to Longa; Castro and Gueteria were
evacuated; and south of the Ebro, every post, one after the
other, was yielded to the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Successes followed the march of the allies. Suchet retired
from Valencia on the 6th of July; and Joseph Buonaparte
was driven from the valley of San Estevan on the 7th by Hill
and Lord Dalhousie—the first marching by the pass of Lanz,
while the other turned the right of the enemy.</p>

<p>Wellington was now in possession of the passes of the Pyrenees;
and in the short space of two months had moved his
victorious army across the kingdom of Spain, and changed
his cantonments from the frontier of Portugal to a position in
the Pyrenees, from which he looked down upon the southern
provinces of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
Napoleon received intelligence of Lord Wellington’s successes
with feelings of undissembled anger and surprise. To
recover the line of the Ebro was his instant determination—for
he knew the dangerous effect the presence of a British
army on the frontier of “beautiful France” must of necessity
produce. Marshal Soult was, therefore, specially despatched
from Germany to assume the chief command of the beaten
army, and, if possible, restore its fallen fortunes.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>Wellington foresaw the coming storm, and turned his immediate
attention to the reduction of Pamplona and San
Sebastian. From the strength of the former, and the excellent
condition of its defences, the allied commander decided
on a blockade; and it was accordingly closely invested by
General Hill. Redoubts were thrown up within fifteen
hundred yards of the place, armed with the cannon taken at
Vitoria—and to the Spanish army under O’Donel the
conduct of the blockade was entrusted.</p>

<p>Graham, with his corps augmented to ten thousand men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
was directed to besiege San Sebastian; and on the 11th of
July, he sat down before the place.</p>

<p>San Sebastian is built on a peninsula, its western defences
washed by the sea, and its eastern by the river Urumea, which
at high water rises several feet above the base of the escarp
wall. A bold and rocky height, called Monte Orgullo, rises
at the extreme point of a narrow neck of land—and on its
summit stands the citadel of La Mota.</p>

<p>Eight hundred yards distant from the land-front, the convent
of San Bartolemeo, with a redoubt and circular field-work,
were garrisoned. These advanced posts were strongly
fortified—and, as it was determined to breach the eastern wall
and storm it afterwards at low water, when the receding tide
should permit an advance by the left of the Urumea, it became
necessary, as a preliminary step, to dislodge the enemy from
the convent.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July, the guns in battery opened a heavy
fire on San Bartolemeo; and by the next day the walls of
the building were injured considerably. Another battery,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>
erected beyond the Urumea, fired with equal success upon the
bastion; and on the 17th both works were carried by assault.
Batteries, armed with thirty-two siege guns and howitzers,
opened on the town wall from the sandhills; and on the 25th
two breaches were effected, one of thirty yards extent, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
the other of ten. A mine was also driven under the glacis—and
at its explosion was the appointed signal for an assault
upon the breaches.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p>At first the astounding noise distracted the garrison, and
enabled the advance of both storming parties to gain the
breaches; but the French recovered from their panic, and
poured such a fire of grape and musketry on the assailants,
that the breach was heaped with dead and dying, and the
allies were driven back to the trenches with a loss of above
six hundred men.—The loss of the British, from the 7th to
the 27th of July, amounted to two hundred and four killed,
seven hundred and seventy-four wounded, and three hundred
missing.</p>

<p>This severe repulse, added to the certain intelligence that
Soult was preparing to strike a grand blow, induced Lord
Wellington to issue immediate orders to raise the siege.</p>

<p>Circumstances, indeed, rendered that step unavoidable.
The French were already in motion—Soult had forced the
passes on the right, penetrated the valleys of the Pyrenees,
and was marching to relieve Pamplona.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington had a most extensive, and, consequently,
a very difficult position to defend,—his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> covering
an extent of country extending, from flank to flank, over
sixty miles of mountains, without lateral communications, or
the means of holding a disposable reserve in the rear of passes,
all of which must be defended, as the loss of one would render
the defence of the others unavailing.</p>

<p>After issuing a spirited proclamation<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> to his army, Soult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
lost no time in commencing operations. His corps had been
organized anew, strongly reinforced, and strengthened in every
arm, and more particularly in artillery. To relieve Pamplona,
it would be necessary to carry the passes of Maya and Roncesvalles;
and accordingly, the French marshal suddenly
assembled the wings of his army and a division of the centre,
at St. Jean Pied de Port; while D’Erlon, with the remainder
of the corps, concentrated at Espaletta.</p>

<p>By feints upon the smaller passes of Espagne and Lereta,
D’Erlon masked his real attempt, which was to be made upon
that of Maya, by a mountain path from Espaletta. From
several suspicious appearances an attack was dreaded by the
allies, and some light companies had been ordered up—and,
with the pickets, they were assailed at noon in such force,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>
that, though supported by the 34th, 50th, and 92nd, they
were driven back on a height communicating with Echalar
when, reinforced by Barnes’s brigade of the seventh division,
they succeeded in repulsing the attack and holding their
ground again.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
The affair was very sanguinary. One wing of the 92nd
was nearly cut to pieces. All the regiments engaged highly
distinguished themselves, and the 82nd in particular. The
allies lost nearly two thousand men, and four pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>Soult’s advance on Roncesvalles was made in imposing
force; but his movements were foreseen, and the necessary
dispositions had been made for defeating them. General Byng,
who commanded, sent Morillo’s Spanish division to observe
the road of Arbaicete, by which the pass of Maya might
have been turned on the right; and descending the heights,
placed his own brigade in a position by which that important
road might be covered more effectually. Soult, however, directed
his true attack upon the left. Cole was overpowered
and driven back—but the fusilier brigade sustained him—and
the attack throughout being met with steady gallantry, was
eventually defeated.</p>

<p>On Byng’s division the French marshal directed his next
effort; and with a force so superior, that, though obstinately
resisted, it proved successful, so far as it obliged the weak brigades
of the English general to fall back upon the mountains,
and abandon the Arbaicete road, while Morillo’s Spaniards
were driven on the fourth division. Necessarily the whole fell
back at night-fall, and took a position in front of Zubiri.</p>

<p>Picton’s division united with the fourth next morning, and
both fell leisurely back as the Duke of Dalmatia advanced.
Picton continued retiring on the 27th, and that evening took
a position in front of Pamplona to cover the blockade, General
Hill having already fallen back on Irurita.</p>

<p>Nearly at this time Lord Wellington had come up; putting
in motion the several corps which lay in his route to the scene
of action—and at one end of a mountain village he pencilled
a despatch, as a French detachment had entered by the other.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
Having despatched the order, he galloped to the place where
Picton’s divisions were drawn up—the third, on the right, in
front of Huarte, and extending to the heights of Olaz—and the
fourth, with Byng’s and Campbell’s brigades, formed on the
left; their right on the road from Roncesvalles to Zubiri, and
the left commanding that from Ostiz to Pamplona. The reserve
was formed of the corps of Morillo and O’Donel—while, on
the only ground on which cavalry could act, the British dragoons
were formed under Sir Stapleton Cotton.</p>

<p>Soult had occupied the high grounds in the front of those
held by the allies—and in the evening he made an effort to
possess a hill occupied by a Portuguese and Spanish brigade on
the right of the fourth division. These troops steadily resisted
the attack—and, supported by a British and Spanish regiment,
repulsed the French, until darkness ended the firing on both
sides.</p>

<p>Pack’s division came up on the 28th, and took a position in
the rear of the fourth division, covering the valley of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
Lanz. The village of Sorauren in their front was held by the
French; from which, in considerable force, they moved forward,
and attacked the sixth division. But this movement
was exposed to a flanking fire, that obliged the enemy to retire
after suffering a serious loss. On the left of the division, a
regiment of Portuguese caçadores was driven back by a simultaneous
attack—but Ross’s brigade came rapidly forward,
and completely repulsed the French. On the right, a renewed
effort partially succeeded, as the Spanish regiments were deforced;
but the 40th came to the charge, and cleared the hill
of the enemy.</p>

<p>The French marshal’s efforts had been directed against the
whole of the height held by the fourth division. In almost all
he was repelled—but on the right of the brigade of Ross,
Soult was for a time successful—and Campbell’s Portuguese
regiments, unable to bear the furious and sustained attack, lost
ground, and allowed the enemy to establish a strong body of
troops within the allied position. Of necessity, General Ross,
having his flank turned, immediately fell back. Wellington
saw the crisis, and the 27th and 48th were directed to recover
the ground with the bayonet. Ross moved forward in support,—a
brilliant and bloody struggle terminated in the total
repulse of the French division, which with severe loss, was
precipitately driven from the height it had with such difficulty
gained. At this period of the fight, Pack’s brigade advanced
up the hill. The French gave up further efforts on the position,—and
a long, sanguinary, and determined contest terminated.</p>

<p>The fourth division in this affair had been most gloriously
distinguished. The bayonet, in every trying exigency, was
resorted to—the charges were frequent—and some regiments,
the fusiliers (7th and 23rd), with the 20th and 40th, repeatedly
checked an advance, or recovered lost ground, by “steel
alone.”</p>

<p>Hill’s division had marched by Lanz, and Lord Dalhousie
from San Estevan on Lizasso, and reached it on the 28th—while
the seventh division moved to Marcelain, and covered
the Pamplona road. Soult, failing in his efforts on the front
of the position, determined to attack Hill’s corps, turn the left
of the allies, and thus relieve Pamplona.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
D’Erlon had reached Ostiz on the 29th, and Soult detached
a division from his own position to strengthen him. During
the night of the 29th, he crossed the Lanz, and occupied the
heights in front of the sixth and seventh divisions—and withdrawing
the corps hitherto posted opposite the third English
division, his left wing closed in on the main position of the
mountain, directly in front of the fourth division. D’Erlon’s
corps, now considerably strengthened, communicated by the
right of the Lanz with the heights occupied by their left.</p>

<p>These dispositions of the French marshal were at once penetrated
by Lord Wellington, and he decided on driving the
enemy from the main position, which, from its importance, was
very strongly occupied.</p>

<p>Picton, crossing the heights from which the French corps
had been recently withdrawn, turned the left of their position
on the road to Roncesvalles, while Lord Dalhousie
advanced against the heights in front of the seventh division,
and gained their right flank. Pakenham, with the sixth
division, turned the village of Sorauren, and, assisted by
Byng’s brigade, carried that of Ostiz. These flank movements
were executed with admirable rapidity, and enabled Cole, with
part of the fourth division, to assault the front of the enemy’s
position. His attack succeeded. The French gave way,—a
noble chain of posts was forced on every side, as well by the
dashing gallantry of the troops as the excellent dispositions of
their leader.</p>

<p>The French had endeavoured to outflank General Hill; but
Pringle’s brigade manœuvred on the heights above the La
Zarza road, and as the enemy extended by the right, they
observed a parallel direction. During these movements front
attacks were frequently and furiously made, and always repulsed
by the bayonet. Sir Rowland steadily maintained his
position behind Lizasso, until a strong corps, detached by
D’Erlon, succeeded in filing round the left flank of the British
brigades. No result of any importance ensued—for Hill leisurely
retired on a mountain position at Eguarras, a mile in
the rear, and every attempt made by d’Erlon to dislodge him
proved a failure.</p>

<p>That night, Soult, discomfited in his numerous and well-sustained
attacks on every position of the allied lines, fell back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
and was vigorously pursued by his opponent.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Two divisions
were overtaken at the pass of Donna Maria, and brought to
action. Although most formidably posted, they were driven
from their ground by the second and seventh divisions—while
at another point, Barnes’s brigade made a daring and successful
attack on a corps of much superior strength, formed in a difficult
position.</p>

<p>Wellington continued the pursuit to Irurita, the French
retiring rapidly towards the frontier, from whence they had
so confidently advanced, and on which they were as promptly
obliged to recede. In their retreat through the valley of the
Bidassao, the enemy’s loss in prisoners and baggage was considerable.
A large convoy was taken at Elizondo, and on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
night of the 1st of August, the entire of the French corps
were driven from the Spanish territory, and the British
bivouacs once more established on the same ground which
they had occupied previous to the advance of the Duke of
Dalmatia.</p>

<p>During the continued series of bold operations, and constant
and sustained attacks, the loss on both sides could not but be
immense.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> Soult’s amounted to at least eight thousand, and
Wellington’s to eight hundred and eighty-one killed, five
thousand five hundred and ten wounded, and seven hundred
and five missing. That the French marshal was perfectly confident
of succeeding, could be inferred from the tone of his
address to the army, and the mass of cavalry and immense parc
of guns,<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> with which he had provided himself, and which, as
they could not be employed in mountain combats, were evidently
designed to assist in future operations that should succeed his
deforcement of the allies from the Pyrenees, and the raising of
the blockade of Pamplona. That garrison had sallied on the
28th and seized on several batteries; but these were immediately
recovered, and the sortie defeated by the division of
Don Carlos. Nothing could have been more annoying to the
French marshal, than that he should have actually reached
within one league of the blockaded fortress, and never be permitted
afterwards to open the slightest communication with
its garrison.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_36">SIEGE OF SAN SEBASTIAN</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Mountain bivouacs of the allies.—Siege of San Sebastian resumed.—Town
taken by assault.—Affair of San Marcial.—Castle invested.—The
garrison surrender.—Operations of the Anglo-Sicilian army.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the retreat of Soult, the British and their allies
resumed the positions from which they had been dislodged
by the advance of the French marshal, and re-established
head-quarters at Lezeca. A short period of comparative
inactivity succeeded: immediate operations could not be commenced
on either side,—the enemy had been too severely
repulsed to permit their becoming assailants again; while, on
the other hand, Wellington would not be justified in crossing
the frontier and entering a hostile country, with Pamplona
and San Sebastian in his rear, and garrisoned by the
French.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more magnificent than the positions of
the British brigades.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> For many a mile along the extended
line of occupation, huts crowning the heights or studding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
deep valleys below them, showed the rude dwellings of the
mighty mass of human beings collected in that Alpine country.
At night the scene was still more picturesque. The irregular
surface of the sierras sparkled with a thousand watch-fires,
and the bivouacs of the allies exhibited all the varieties of
light and shadow which an artist loves to copy. To the
occupants themselves, the views obtained from their elevated
abodes were grand and imposing. One while obscured in fog,
the hum of voices alone announced that their comrades were
beside them, while at another, the sun bursting forth in cloudless
beauty, displayed a varied scene, glorious beyond imagination.
At their feet the fertile plains of France presented
themselves,—above, ranges of magnificent heights towered in
majestic grandeur to the skies, and stretched into distance
beyond the range of sight.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>Although no military movements were made, this inactive
interval of a vigorous campaign was usefully employed by the
allied commander, in organizing anew the regiments that had
suffered most, concentrating the divisions, replacing exhausted
stores, and perfecting the whole <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of the army. Those
of the British near the coast, compared with the corps that
were blockading Pamplona, lived comfortably in their mountain
bivouacs; indeed, the task of covering a blockade is the
most disagreeable that falls to the soldier’s lot. Exposed to
cold and rain, continually on the alert, and yet engaged in a
duty devoid of enterprise and interest, nothing could be more
wearying to the troops employed; and desertions, which
during active service were infrequent, now became numerous,
and especially among the Spaniards and Irish.</p>

<p>The siege of San Sebastian was renewed. Guns, formerly
employed, were re-landed,—the trenches occupied again,—and
a large supply of heavy ordnance and mortars, received
opportunely from England, were placed in battery. Lord
Wellington was reinforced by a company of sappers and
miners—and the navy, under Sir George Collier, assisted
him with both men and guns.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> The batteries were consequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
enlarged—and a furious sortie by the garrison
on the night of the 24th producing little effect, on the
26th a crushing fire opened from fifty-seven pieces of siege
artillery.</p>

<p>On the same night the island of Santa Clara, situated at
the entrance of the harbour, and partially enfilading the
defences of the castle, was surprised and stormed by a mixed
party of sailors and soldiers, and its garrison made prisoners.
On the 27th, a second sortie on the whole front of the isthmus
failed entirely, and the assailants were instantly driven back.
The siege and working artillery<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> had been now augmented to
eighty pieces—and on the 30th the breaches were so extensively
battered down, that Lord Wellington issued orders that
they should be assaulted, and the next morning was named for
the attempt.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>In the annals of modern warfare, perhaps there is no conflict
recorded which was so sanguinary and so desperate as the
storming of that well-defended breach. During the blockade,
every resource of military ingenuity was tried by the French
governor—and the failure of the first assault, with the subsequent
raising of the siege, emboldened the garrison, and
rendered them the more confident of holding out until Soult
could advance and succour them. The time from which the
battering guns had been withdrawn, until they had been
again placed in battery, was assiduously employed in constructing
new defences and strengthening the old ones. But
though the place when reinvested was more formidable than
before, the besiegers appeared only the more determined to
reduce it.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
Morning broke gloomily—an intense mist obscured every
object, and the work of slaughter was for a time delayed.
At nine the sea-breeze cleared away the fog; the sun shone
gloriously out—and in two hours the forlorn hope issued from
the trenches. The columns succeeded,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>—and every gun from
the fortress that could bear, opened on them with shot and
shells. The appearance of the breach was perfectly delusive;
nothing living could reach the summit—no courage, however
desperate, could overcome the difficulties, for they were alike
unexpected and insurmountable. In vain the officers rushed
forward, and devotedly were they followed by their men.
From intrenched houses behind the breach, the traverses, and
the ramparts of the curtain, a withering discharge of musketry
was poured on the assailants, while the Mirador and
Prince batteries swept the approaches with their guns. To
survive this concentrated fire was impossible; the forlorn hope
were cut off to a man, and the heads of the columns annihilated.
At last the debouches were choked with the dead and
wounded, and a further passage to the breach rendered impracticable
from the heap of corpses that were piled upon each other.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>Then, in that desperate moment, when hope might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
been supposed to be over, an expedient unparalleled in the
records of war was resorted to. The British batteries opened
on the curtain—and the storming parties heard with surprise
the roar of cannon in the rear, while, but a few feet above their
heads, their iron shower hissed horribly, and swept away the
enemy and their defences.</p>

<p>This was the moment for a fresh effort. Another brigade
was moved forward—and favoured by an accidental explosion
upon the curtain, which confused the enemy while it encouraged
the assailants, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">terre-plain</i> was mounted, and the
French driven from the works. A long and obstinate resistance
was continued in the streets, which were in many places
barricaded—but by five in the evening opposition had ceased,
and the town was in the possession of the British. Seven hundred
of the garrison were prisoners—and the remainder were
either disabled in the assault or shut up in the castle.</p>

<p>The unfortunate town seemed alike devoted by friends and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
enemies to destruction. The conquerors were roaming through
the streets—the castle firing on the houses beneath its guns—in
many places fires had broken out—and a storm of
thunder, rain, and lightning, added to the confusion of a scene
which even in warfare finds no parallel.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<p>The assault of San Sebastian cost a large expense of life,
there being seven hundred and sixty-one killed, one thousand
six hundred and ninety-seven wounded, and forty-five missing,
and in that number many valuable officers were included.
The head of the engineer department, Sir Richard Fletcher,
was killed—and Generals Leith,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Oswald, and Robinson were
returned in the list of wounded.</p>

<p>The Spanish corps of Friere formed a part of the covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
army, and occupied the heights of San Marcial. Their front
and left flank were covered by the Bidassao, and their right
appuied upon the Sierra de Haya. On these heights Longa’s
guerillas were posted, and the first division in rear of Irun.
The reserve was behind the left.</p>

<p>The French shewed themselves at Yera on the 30th, and in
consequence, Generals Inglis and Ross were moved, the former
to the bridge of Lezeca, and the latter to a position on the
Haya mountain, while a Portuguese brigade secured it from
being turned on the right.</p>

<p>Two of the enemy’s divisions forded the river on the morning
of the 31st, and, in the front of the Spanish left wing, mounted
the heights with determined gallantry. On this occasion the
Spaniards behaved with courage worthy of their once chivalric
name. Coolly waiting until the French divisions had
topped the heights, they rushed forward with the bayonet,
and bore them down the hill. So completely were they broken
by this sudden and unexpected charge, that driven into
the river by the impetuosity of their assailants, many missed
the fords and perished.</p>

<p>Undismayed by the repulse, a pontoon bridge was thrown
across the Bidassao—and passing fourteen thousand men, the
French advanced again with renewed confidence against the
Spanish lines. Wellington, in person, was present on the hill—his
appearance was enthusiastically hailed—and deeds
afterwards attested how powerful the influence of that presence
proved. Before the French could gain the summit, the Spanish
battalions boldly advanced to meet them—a bayonet rush
was made—the enemy recoiled—the allies pressed them closely—a
panic resulted—some rushed into the deeps of the Bidassao,
and were drowned; others succeeded in finding the fords
and escaped. A multitude hurried towards the bridge, but it
was soon choked with fugitives—the pressure became too
heavy for the pontoons to support—it sank suddenly—and of
those upon it at the moment, few gained the other bank.</p>

<p>A renewed discomfiture, attended with such fatal consequences,
and achieved by troops they had hitherto despised,
astonished and chagrined the French officers; while the allied
leader, surprised by this brilliant display of unwonted heroism,
bestowed his highest commendation on the Spanish troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
A simultaneous attack was made on the road leading to San
Sebastian by the right of the Haya mountain, which runs past
the village of Oyarzum. As the position was defective, the
Portuguese brigade, which with Inglis’s corps had been intrusted
with its defence, fell back on the bold and rocky ridge
on which stands the convent of San Antonio. Here, too, the
French efforts were unavailing, and the enemy retired in despair.
In the mean time heavy rains had caused a mountain
flood—the river became impassable, the fords could not be
crossed, and the bridge of Vera offered the only point by
which they could retreat. That passage could not be effected
with rapidity—and before one half of the French column had
defiled, the light divisions were on the banks, and had opened
a severe and constant fire. This, with other losses, made the
effort to relieve San Sebastian a most infelicitous attempt.
Two generals and fifteen hundred men were lost on these
occasions—and that, too, by a signal repulse from a force
invariably mentioned by the French marshals as contemptible.</p>

<p>Vigorous measures were in preparation for the reduction of
the castle of San Sebastian. From the height of its escarp,
and the solidity of the masonry, La Mota could not be assaulted
with any certainty of success—and a regular investment was
requisite to obtain the place.</p>

<p>On the 1st of September the mortar-batteries commenced
throwing shells;<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> and as the castle was indifferently provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
with bomb-proof casemates, a considerable loss induced the
governor<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> to offer a capitulation, but the terms were not such
as could be granted. Batteries with heavy ordnance were
erected on the works of the town, and on the 8th opened with
such terrible effect, that in two hours the place was unconditionally
surrendered.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> The garrison amounted to eighteen
hundred men, of whom nearly a third were disabled.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
San Sebastian was held to the last with excellent judgment
and dauntless gallantry. Indeed, the loss of the besiegers
bore melancholy confirmation of the fact,—for the reduction
of that fortress cost the allies nearly four thousand men.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Before we record the triumphant entrance into the French
territory by the allied troops, it may be necessary to casually
notice the proceedings of the Anglo-Sicilian army in the east
of Spain.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington had arranged, as a part of the military
operations of the brilliant campaign of 1813, the liberation of
Valencia, by forcing Suchet from that province, and obliging
him to abandon afterwards the line of the Lower Ebro. This
was perfectly practicable. The Spanish commanders were in
force in Catalonia,—Del Parque in Murcia and Grenada,—the
coast was open to the English shipping—and Sir John
Murray could embark at Alicant, and land his army on any
part of Catalonia that he pleased.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan, Sir John Murray appeared before
Tarragona on the 2nd of June, landed next morning, and
invested the place. His opening operations were successful.
Fort Balaguer, after a day’s bombardment, surrendered; and
the French were confined to the possession of the inner defences
of the town.</p>

<p>The siege was proceeding with every promise of a successful
result, when Murray, learning that Suchet was advancing
from Valencia, and Mathieu from Barcelona, raised it with
such unnecessary precipitation, that nineteen battering guns
were abandoned in the trenches, and the infantry and cavalry
reimbarked with an ill-judged haste, that at the time not only
produced considerable dissatisfaction among the troops, but
afterwards subjected Sir John Murray to a court-martial.
That it was a most uncalled for proceeding on the part of the
English general was subsequently ascertained,—for, and at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
same moment, Murray, Suchet, and Mathieu were actually
retiring from each other.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Murray suspected that he should
be exposed to a combined attack—Mathieu dared not venture
singly on the English—and Suchet, having left his artillery at
Tortosa, feared to attack while unprovided with that most
essential arm.</p>

<p>Lord William Bentinck’s subsequent attempt on Tarragona,
when Suchet retreated from the Ebro into Catalonia, was
equally unsuccessful. Having moved from Villa Franca and
advanced across to Ordal, on the night of the 12th of September,
he was furiously attacked, and driven back on the
main body, with a loss of four guns, and a thousand men
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. The British retreated, pursued by Suchet
and Decaen; and, after an affair between the Brunswick hussars
and a French cuirassier regiment, highly creditable to the
former, the English returned to Tarragona, and the French to
their cantonments on the Llobregat. Lord William resigned
the command to General Clinton, and resumed that which he
had previously held in Sicily.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_37">PASSAGE OF THE BIDASSAO.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Passage of the Bidassao.—Fall of Pamplona.</p></blockquote>

<p>The capture of San Sebastian permitted the allied leader to
prepare for a decisive movement so soon as the reduction of
Pamplona should warrant his advance across the frontier.
The enemy were strongly posted on the right bank of the
Bidassao,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> in front of Vera—and preparatory to assuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
the offensive, Wellington determined to force that position
and occupy it himself.</p>

<p>Every arrangement was made with his habitual secrecy.
The fords were sounded and marked by fishermen, who
created no suspicion, as, to all appearance, they were following
their customary avocation, and hence their proceedings were
unnoticed by the French videts. All was prepared for the
attempt—and at midnight, on the 6th of October, the British
divisions got silently under arms. A storm was raging furiously—thunder
was pealing round them—lightning, in quick
and vivid flashes, flared across the murky sky—the elemental
uproar was reverberated among the alpine heights above—and
a wilder night was never chosen for a military operation.
Gradually the tempest exhausted its fury—the wind fell—the
rain ceased—an overwhelming heat succeeded—and when the
morning broke, the leading brigades, at seven different points,
plunged into the Bidassao; while a rocket rose from the
ancient steeple of Fontarabia, and the signal was answered
from the heights by a combined movement of all the divisions
there drawn up in order of battle.</p>

<p>Perfect success crowned this daring essay. The leading
columns were nearly across the river before the French fire
opened. Ground, difficult and broken in itself, had been
carefully strengthened with numerous field-works; but all
gave way before the desperate valour of the assailants. The
light division, with the Spaniards under Longa,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> carried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
intrenched position of Puerto-de-Vera. Redoubt and abbatis
were stoutly defended; but from all, in quick succession, the
enemy was driven at the point of the bayonet. Night fell—the
attack had everywhere succeeded—and the victors bivouacked
on the field they won; and, for the first time, the allied
forces slept upon French ground.</p>

<p>Here the British commander established himself, and
awaited the fall of Pamplona, which Soult’s repeated defeats
rendered inevitable. The garrison still obstinately held out:
and when their provisions were nearly exhausted, it was
rumoured that they intended, rather than surrender, to blow
up the works, and take their chance of escaping.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> But an
assurance from the Spanish commander, Don Carlos, that,
should the place be destroyed, he would hang the governor
and officers, and decimate the men, prevented the attempt;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
and, on the 30th of October, the garrison yielded themselves
prisoners of war, and the place surrendered.</p>

<p>Winter had now set in, and a season of unusual severity
commenced. The allies were sadly exposed to the weather,
and an increasing difficulty was felt every day in procuring
necessary supplies. Forage became so scarce, that part of the
cavalry had nothing for their horses but grass; while the
cattle for the soldiers’ rations, driven sometimes from the
interior of Spain, perished in immense numbers by the way,
or reached the camp so wretchedly reduced in condition as to
be little better than carrion. Resources from the sea could
not be trusted to; for in blowing weather the coast was
scarcely approachable, and even in the sheltered harbour of
Passages, the transports could with difficulty ride to their
moorings, in consequence of the heavy swell that tumbled in
from the Atlantic. The cold became intense,—sentries were
frozen at their posts,—and a picket at Roncesvalles, regularly
snowed up, was saved with great difficulty. All this plainly
shewed that the present position of the allies was not tenable
much longer, and that a forward movement into France was
unavoidable.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<p>But great difficulties in advancing presented themselves;
and, all things considered, success was a matter of uncertainty.
Soult’s army had been powerfully reinforced by the last conscription;
and for three months the French marshal had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
indefatigable in fortifying the whole line of his position, and
strengthening his defences, wherever the ground would admit
an enemy to approach. The field-works extended from the
sea to the river, as the right rested on St. Jean-de-Luz, and
the left on the Nivelle. The centre was at Mont La
Rhune and the heights of Sarré. The whole position passed
in a half-circle through Irogne, Ascain, Sarré, Ainhoue, and
Espelette. Though the centre was commanded by a higher
ridge, a narrow valley interposed between them. The entire
front was covered with works, and the sierras defended by a
chain of redoubts. The centre was particularly strong—in
fact, it was a work regularly ditched and palisaded.</p>

<p>To turn the position, by advancing Hill’s corps through
St. Jean Pied-de-Port, was first determined on; but, on consideration,
this plan of operations was abandoned,—and,
strong as the centre was, the allied leader resolved that on it
his attack should be directed, while the heights of Ainhoue,
which formed its support, should, if possible, be simultaneously
carried.</p>

<p>A commander less nerved than Lord Wellington, would
have lacked resolution for this bold and masterly operation.
Everything was against him, and every chance favoured the
enemy. The weather was dreadful—the rain fell in torrents,—and
while no army could move, the French had the advantage
of the delay to complete the defences of a position which
was already deemed perfect as art and nature could render it.
Nor did their powerful works produce in the enemy a false
security. Aware of the man and the troops which threatened
them—they were always ready for an attack—and their outpost
duty was rigidly attended to. Before day their corps
were under arms—and the whole line of defences continued
fully garrisoned until night permitted the troops to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>At last the weather moderated. On the 7th, Ainhoue was
reconnoitred by Wellington in person, and the plan of the
attack arranged. No operation could be more plain or
straightforward. The centre was to be carried by columns of
divisions, and the right centre turned. To all the corps their
respective points of attack were assigned,—while to the light
division and Longa’s Spaniards the storming of La Petite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
Rhune was confided. The latter were to be supported by
Alten’s cavalry, three brigades of British artillery, and three
mountain guns.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>The 8th had been named for the attack—but the roads
were so dreadfully cut up, that neither the artillery nor Hill’s
brigade could get into position, and it was postponed for two
days longer—when the 10th dawned, a clear and moonlight
morning. Long before day, Lord Wellington, and several of
the generals of division and brigade with their respective staffs,
had assembled in a small wood, five hundred yards from the
redoubt above the village of Sarré, waiting for sufficient light
to commence the arranged attack.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the courage and rapidity with which
the troops rushed on, and overcame every artificial and natural
obstacle. The 3rd and 7th advanced in front of the village—Downie’s
Spanish brigade attacked the right—while the left
was turned by Cole’s, and the whole of the first line of
defences remained in possession of the allies.</p>

<p>On this glorious occasion, the light division was preeminently
distinguished. By moonlight it moved from the
greater La Rhune, and formed in a ravine which separates the
bolder from the lesser height. This latter was occupied in
force by the enemy, and covered on every assailable point
with intrenchments. As morning broke, the British light
troops rushed from the hollow which had concealed them. To
withstand their assault was impossible—work after work was
stormed; forward they went with irresistible bravery, and on
the summit of the hill united themselves with Cole’s division,
and then pushed on against the intrenched heights behind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
which formed the strongest part of the position. Here, a
momentary check arrested their progress—the supporting force
(Spanish) were too slow, and the ground too rugged for the
horse artillery to get over it at speed. The rifles were
attacked in turn, and for a moment driven back by a mass of
the enemy. But the reserve came up; and again the light
troops rushed forward—the French gave way—and the whole
of the lower ridge was left in possession of the assailants.</p>

<p>For four hours the combat had raged, and on every point
the British were victorious. A more formidable position still
remained behind—and Wellington combined his efforts for a
vigorous and general attack.</p>

<p>This mountain position extended from Mondarin to Ascain—and
a long valley, through which the Nivelle flows, traversed
it; where the surface was unequal, the higher points
were crowned with redoubts, and the spaces of leveller surface
occupied by the French in line or column, as the nature of
the ground best admitted. Men inclined to fight never had a
field that offered so many advantages; and there were none,
save the British leader and the splendid army he commanded,
who would have ventured to assault equal numbers posted as
the enemy were.</p>

<p>The dispositions were soon complete—the word was given—and
in six columns, with a chain of skirmishers in front,
the allies advanced to the attack.</p>

<p>To carry a strong work, or assail a body of infantry in close
column, placed on the crest of an acclivity that requires the
attacking force to halt frequently for breathing-time, requires
a desperate and enduring valour which few armies can boast—but
such bravery on that occasion characterised the allied
divisions. Masses posted on a steep height were forced from
it by the bayonet, though hand and foot were often required
to enable the assaulting party to reach them. Redoubts were
carried at a run, or so rapidly turned by the different brigades,
that the defenders had scarcely time to escape by the rear.
Nothing could resist the dash and intrepidity of the British;
and over the whole extent of that formidable position, on no
point did the attack fail.</p>

<p>The French were driven from their works, and forced in
great confusion on the bridge of the Nivelle. One redoubt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
from its superior strength, had been obstinately maintained—but
the regiment that occupied it was completely cut off from
retreating, and the whole were made prisoners.</p>

<p>In every other point the British attack succeeded. Hill’s
division carried the heights of Ainhoue, the whole of the redoubts
falling to the British and Portuguese under Hamilton;
while Stewart drove the enemy from a parallel ridge in the
rear—and the divisions, by an united attack, forcing the
enemy from their works at Espelette, obliged them to retire
towards Cambo,—thus gaining the rear of the position originally
occupied, and forcing Soult’s centre on his right.</p>

<p>The French marshal formed in great force on the high
grounds over Ascain and St. Pe, and Lord Wellington made
instant dispositions to attack him. Three divisions, the third,
sixth, and seventh, advanced against the heights—two by the
left of the Nivelle, and one, the sixth, by the right bank. As
the position was exceedingly strong, the enemy determined to
hold it to the last, and maintained a furious cannonade, supported
by a heavy fire of musketry. But the steady and imposing
advance of the allies could not be repelled—and the
French retired hastily. The right of the position was thus
entirely cut through—and though for months the Duke of
Dalmatia had been arming every vulnerable point, and his
engineers had used their utmost skill in perfecting its defences,
the British commander’s dispositions were so admirably made
and so gallantly carried out, that his numerous and most difficult
attacks were crowned with brilliant success, unalloyed
by a single failure.</p>

<p>Night ended the battle,—the firing ceased—Soult retreated
and, covered by the darkness, withdrew a beaten army, that
had numbered fully seventy thousand men. His killed and
wounded exceeded three thousand, besides a loss of fifty guns,
and twelve hundred prisoners. The allies reckoned their
casualties at two thousand four hundred killed and wounded;
which, the nature of the ground, the strength of its defences,
and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> that held it, considered, was indeed a
loss comparatively light.</p>

<h2 id="chap_38">PASSAGE OF THE ADOUR.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>French and English positions.—Wellington advances.—The left wing of
the allies attacked.—Soult defeated.—The French marshal attacks the
right, and is severely repulsed by General Hill.—Sir Rowland drives
the French from their position, and Soult retires within his lines.—Defection
of German regiments, who come over to the allies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Soult halted his different corps in the intrenched camp of
Bayonne, and Wellington cantoned his troops two miles in
front of his opponent, in lines extending from the sea to the
Nivelle, his right stretching to Cambo and his left resting on
the coast. This change in his cantonments was productive of
serious advantages. His wearied soldiery obtained rest and
many comforts which in their mountain bivouacs were unattainable;
and though the enemy possessed unlimited command
of a well-supplied district for their foraging parties, and the
surface over which Lord Wellington might obtain supplies
was necessarily circumscribed, his direct communication with
the sea, and a month’s rest in tolerable quarters, recruited his
exhausted army and produced the best results.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
But Wellington merely waited to mature his preparations—and,
to extend his line of supply, he determined to seize the
strong ground between the Nive and the Adour, and confine
Soult to the immediate vicinity of his own camp. Accordingly
on the 9th of December, the left wing of the allies, advancing
by the road of St. Jean de Luz, gained the heights domineering
the intrenchments of the French. The right forded
the Nive above Cambo—while, by a bridge of boats, Clinton
crossed at Nostariz, and obliged the enemy, to avoid being cut
off, to fall back on Bayonne. At night, the French having
retired to their posts within the fortified position they had
occupied, Hope, with the left of the allies, recrossed the river
to his former cantonments, having a direct communication open
with Sir Rowland Hill, who had taken a position with his
division, his right on the Adour, his centre in the village of
St. Pierre, and his left appuied on the heights of Ville Franque.
Morillo’s division was in observation at Urcuray, and a cavalry
corps at Hasparren.</p>

<p>The relative positions of the rival armies were greatly different.
Soult possessed immense advantages; his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i>
were compactly bivouacked, with easy communications, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
facility for rapid concentration, and the citadel of Bayonne to
protect him if he found it necessary to fall back. The allies
extended over an irregular line intersected by the Nive, with
bad roads, that rendered any rapid reinforcement of a threatened
point altogether impracticable. Hence, Wellington was
everywhere open to attack—and Soult could fall on him with
overwhelming numbers and force an unequal combat, while
but a part of the allies should be opposed to the combined
efforts of the enemy. The French marshal was aware of this—and
it was not long before he endeavoured to profit by his
advantage.</p>

<p>The left of the allies, under Sir John Hope, had the fifth
division (Hay’s) posted on the heights of Barouillet, with
Campbell’s Portuguese brigade on a narrow ridge immediately
in their front. At Arrangues, the light division was formed
on a strong height, at a distance of two miles from the fifth.</p>

<p>The positions were separated by the low grounds between
the hills, and the corps were consequently unconnected.
Although both were strongly posted, still, in case of an
attack, each must trust entirely to his own resources, and
repulse the enemy without counting on support from the
other.</p>

<p>Early on the 10th of December, Soult appeared on the road
of St. Jean de Luz, and in great force marched directly against
the allied left. The light and fifth divisions were simultaneously
assailed—the former driven back into its intrenchments,
and Campbell’s brigade forced back upon Hay’s at Barouillet.
The intermediate ground between the allied positions was now
in the possession of the enemy, and thus Soult was enabled to
attack the right of the fifth with vigour. Although assailed
in front and flank, the allied division gallantly withstood the
assault; and when the position was completely penetrated,
and the orchard on the right forced and occupied by the
French with overwhelming numbers, still the British and
Portuguese held the heights, and, while whole sections fell,
not an inch of ground was yielded.</p>

<p>Another and a more determined effort was now made by the
French marshal, and made in vain—for by a bold and well-timed
movement of the 9th British and a Portuguese battalion,
wheeling round suddenly and charging the French rear, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
enemy were driven back with the loss of a number of prisoners.
Fresh troops were fast arriving—the guards came into action—and
Lord Wellington reached the battle-ground from the
right. But the French had been repulsed in their last attempt
so decisively that they did not venture to repeat it—evening
closed—the firing gradually died away—and the allied divisions
held the same positions from which Soult, with an
immense numerical superiority in men and guns, had vainly
striven to force them.</p>

<p>The slaughter was great on both sides—and, wearied by long
sustained exertion, and weakened by its heavy loss, the fifth
division was relieved by the first, who occupied the post their
comrades had maintained so gloriously. The fourth and
seventh were placed in reserve, and enabled, in case of attack,
to assist on either point, should Soult, on the following morning,
as was expected, again attempt to make himself master of
Barouillet.</p>

<p>Nothing could surpass the reckless gallantry displayed by
the British officers throughout this long and sanguinary struggle.
Sir John Hope, with his staff, was always seen where
the contest was most furious; and the only wonder was that
in a combat so close and murderous, one remarkable alike in
personal appearance and “daring deed,” should have outlived
that desperate day. His escapes indeed were many. He
was wounded in the leg—contused in the shoulder—four
musket-bullets passed through his hat, and he lost two horses.
General Robinson, in command of the second brigade, was
badly wounded—and Wellington himself was constantly exposed
to fire. Unable to determine where the grand effort of
his adversary would be directed, he passed repeatedly from
one point of the position to the other—and that life, so valuable
to all beside, seemed “of light estimation” to himself
alone.</p>

<p>The next sun rose to witness a renewal of the contest. In
their attack upon the light division at Arrangues, the French,
driven from the defended posts the château and churchyard
afforded, retired to the plateau of Bassusarry, and there established
themselves for the night. During the forenoon some
slight affairs between the pickets occurred; but at noon, the
fusilade having ceased, the allies collected wood, lighted fires,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
and cooked their dinners. At two, a considerable stir was
visible in the enemy’s line, and their pioneers were seen cutting
down the fence for the passage of artillery. Soult’s first
demonstration of attack was made against Arrangues; but that
was only to mask his real object. Presently his tirailleurs
swarmed out in front of Barouillet, attacked the British outposts,
drove the pickets back, and moving in strong columns
by the Bayonne road, furiously assailed the heights of the
position. The wood-cutters, surprised by the sudden onset of
the French, hurried back to resume their arms and join their
regiments; while the enemy, mistaking the cause of this rush
to their alarm posts, supposed a panic had seized the troops,
and pressed forward with increased impetuosity. But the
same results attended their attempt upon the first as on the
fifth division; and the French were driven back with heavy
loss. In the contests of two days not an inch of ground was
yielded—and the left wing of the allies remained firm in its
position, when night brought the combat to a close.</p>

<p>During the 12th, Soult still continued in front of the heights
of Barouillet, and preserved throughout the day a threatening
attitude. No serious attack, however, was made; some sharp
skirmishing occurred between the pickets, and darkness ended
these occasional affairs.</p>

<p>The grand object of the French marshal in his sustained
attacks upon the allied left, was to force the position and penetrate
to St. Jean de Luz. Although so severely handled in
his attempts upon the 10th and 11th, the bustle visible along
his line, and the activity of the officers of his staff during the
morning of the 12th, shewed that he still meditated a fresh
effort. The imposing appearance of the allied troops on the
heights of Barouillet induced him to change his intention;
and he made arrangements to throw his whole disposable force
suddenly upon the right wing of the British, and attack Sir
Rowland Hill with overwhelming numbers.</p>

<p>This probable attack had been foreseen by Lord Wellington—and,
with his accustomed caution, means had been adopted
to render it unsuccessful. In the event of assistance being
required, the sixth division was placed at Hill’s disposal; and
early on the morning of the 13th, the third and fourth divisions
moved towards the right of the allied lines, and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
held in readiness to pass the river should circumstances demand
it. As Lord Wellington had anticipated, Soult marched his
main body through Bayonne during the night of the 12th, and
at daylight, pushing forward thirty thousand men in columns
of great strength, attacked furiously the right wing of the
allies.</p>

<p>Hill had only fourteen thousand British and Portuguese to
repel the French marshal’s assault, but the ground he occupied
was capable of being vigorously defended. On the right,
General Byng’s brigade was formed in front of the Vieux
Monguerre—occupying a ridge, with the Adour upon the right,
and the left flanked by several mill-dams. General Pringle
held the ridge of Ville Franque with his brigade; the Nive
ran in front of his left, and his right also appuied on several
mill-dams. The brigades of Generals Barnes and Ashworth
were posted on a range of heights opposite the village of St.
Pierre—while two Portuguese brigades were formed in reserve
immediately behind Ville Franque. The general form of the
line nearly described a crescent—and against its concave side,
the efforts of the French marshal were principally directed.
The position extended from the Adour to the Nive, occupying
a space, from right to left, of four miles.</p>

<p>The outposts stationed on the road from Bayonne to St.
Jean Pied de Port were driven back by the enemy’s tirailleurs,
followed by the main body of the French, who mounted
the sloping ground in front of the British position<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>—and
supported by another division, which moved by a hollow way
between the left centre and Pringle’s brigade, they came forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
in massive columns. Sir Rowland Hill at once perceived
that Soult’s design was to force his centre, and carry
the heights of St. Pierre. To strengthen that part of the position,
the brigade of General Byng was promptly moved to the
right of the centre, leaving the third (Buffs) regiment and some
light companies at Vieux Monguerre—while a Portuguese
brigade was marched from behind Ville Franque to support
the left. The sixth division was apprised of the threatened
attack, and an aide-de-camp was despatched to order its immediate
march upon the centre.</p>

<p>The French came on with all the confidence of superior
strength, and a full determination to break through the British
position, and thus achieve upon the right that object which
they had essayed upon the left, and twice in vain. Exposed
to a tremendous fire of grape from the British guns, and a
withering fusilade from the light infantry, they pressed steadily
on, and, by strength of numbers, succeeded in gaining ground
in front of the heights. But further they never could attain,
as the supporting brigades joined on either flank, and every
continued essay to force the centre was repulsed. A long and
bloody combat, when renewed, produced no happier result, for
the allies obstinately held their position. The Buffs and light
companies, who had been forced by an overwhelming superiority
to retire for a time from Vieux Monguerre, re-formed,
charged into the village, and won it back at the point of the
bayonet—when, after exhausting his whole strength in hopeless
efforts to break the British line, Soult abandoned the attack,
and reluctantly gave the order to fall back.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with repelling the enemy’s attack, Hill in turn
became the assailant, and boldly pursued the broken columns
as they retired from the front of the position. On a high
ground in advance of his intrenched lines, Soult drew up in
force, and determined to fall back no further. The hill was
instantly assaulted by Byng’s brigade, led on by the general
in person. Unchecked by a storm of grape and a heavy fire
of musketry, the British, reinforced by a Portuguese brigade,
carried the height, and the French were beaten from a strong
position with a serious loss in men, and the capture of two
pieces of cannon.</p>

<p>The third and sixth divisions came up as quickly as distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
and difficult roads would permit—but the contest was ended;
and Hill,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> unassisted by any supporting troops, had, with his
own corps, achieved a complete and glorious victory. Every
effort, continued with unabated vigour for five hours, and with
decided advantages on his side, had signally failed—and the
Duke of Dalmatia was forced again to retire within his fortified
lines between the Nive and the Adour, while the allies pushed
their advanced posts to the verge of the valley immediately in
front of St. Pierre.</p>

<p>In these continued actions the loss on both sides was immense.
In the casualties of the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and
13th of December, the total, including four generals, amounted
to five thousand and sixty-one <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>The French loss was infinitely greater—it is but a moderate
estimate to place it at six thousand men. Indeed, no contests,
sanguinary as most of them had been during the Peninsular
campaigns, were attended with greater loss of life—and those
well accustomed to view a battle-field expressed astonishment
at the slaughter the limited spaces on which the repeated
struggles had occurred exhibited at the close of every succeeding
engagement.</p>

<p>Soult, defeated in the presence of thousands of his countrymen,
and with every advantage locality could confer, had no
apology to offer for the failure of his attacks—and if any
additional mortification were necessary, the defection of the
regiments of Nassau-Usingen and Frankfort would have
completed it. After the first attempt upon the allied left,
these regiments abandoned the service of Napoleon; and, on
an assurance of their being sent home, they came over in a
body to the fourth division.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>The winter had now set in with severity, and ended all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
military movements for a season.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> The roads were impassable
from constant rain, and the low grounds heavily flooded.
The French took up cantonments on the right bank of the
Adour; while the allies occupied the country between the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
of that river and the sea. Every means were employed to
render the troops comfortable in their winter quarters—and to
guard against surprise, telegraphs were erected in communication
with every post, which, by a simple combination of flags,
transmitted intelligence along the line of the cantonments, and
apprised the detached officers of the earliest movement of the
enemy. Abundant supplies, and the advantage of an open
communication with England, enabled the army to recruit its
strength<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>—and, with occasional interruptions of its quiet, the
year 1813 passed away—and another, “big with the fate of
empires,” was ushered in.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_39">BATTLE OF ORTHEZ.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Weather changes.—Operations recommence.—Harispe driven from his
position by Wellington. Preparations for passing the Adour.—Guards
and Rifles cross over—are attacked, but maintain their ground until
reinforced.—Soult takes a position at Orthez.</p></blockquote>

<p>The intrenchments into which Soult, on the failure of his
attempts upon the allied positions, had withdrawn his troops,
covered the approach to Bayonne on the side opposite to
Anglet, retaining, however, the village and the range of
heights from the Biarits to the Nive. This strong camp rested
its left flank on the river, below the Château de Marrac and
its walled gardens—the whole position forming the segment of
a circle, of which the cathedral of Bayonne might have been
considered a centre, the extension being from the Nive to the
Adour, opposite the Château de St. Bernard.</p>

<p>Soult prolonged his line to the confluence of the Bidouse below
Guiche, and established his head-quarters at Peyrehorade,
at the junction of the Gave de Pau with the Gave d’Oleron. The
right of the French army was commanded by Count Reille,
the left by Clausel, the centre by D’Erlon, and a division at
St. Jean Pied de Port by Harispe.</p>

<p>Six weeks passed on. The weather was too inclement to
allow movements to be made on either side—and the French
marshal was occupied in defending his extensive lines, and the
allied general in preparing secretly for passing the Adour.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
In February the weather changed—the cross roads became
practicable—and Lord Wellington with his characteristic
promptness, commenced preparatory movements for the execution
of his grand conception.</p>

<p>To distract the attention of Soult from the defence of the
Adour, Wellington threatened the French left on the Bidouse,
and directed Hill’s corps against that of Harispe. The latter,
leaving St. Jean Pied de Port garrisoned, fell back on Hellete;
retiring subsequently on the heights of La Montagne, and
next day uniting with another corps. Thus strengthened,
Harispe formed in order of battle on a very strong position to
the right of Garris.</p>

<p>The road, however, communicating with the bridge of St.
Palais was uncovered—and though evening had come on, and
the second division, with a Spanish corps under Morillo, were
alone in hand, Lord Wellington determined to force the position.
The Spaniards were desired to march rapidly on St.
Palais, while, with Stewart’s division, the heights should be
carried. The attack was gallantly made, the enemy offered a
brave resistance,—but the position was stormed in fine style,
and held against every effort the French could make for its
recovery. The contest continued until darkness had shrouded
distant objects, while the battalions still fought with such
furious obstinacy, that volleys were interchanged within pistol
range, and the bayonet frequently resorted to. Finding it
impossible to force those enduring troops from the ground they
seemed determined upon keeping, Harispe, before Morillo
could seize the bridge, succeeded in retiring his beaten corps.
Falling back upon the Gave de Mauleon, he destroyed the
bridge of Navarette; but the river was forded by the British,
Harispe’s position forced, and his division driven behind
Gave d’Oleron.</p>

<p>Soult instantly destroyed the communications, and rendered
the bridges over the Adour impassable. The centre of the
allies being now in force on the Bidouse, and concentrating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
on Sauveterre, the French marshal retired from Bayonne, leaving
a powerful garrison behind him for the protection of that
important city.</p>

<p>All necessary preparations for the passage of the Adour had
been completed, and from the co-operation of the British navy
much assistance was expected. That hope was fully realized;
and the noble exertions of the English sailors on the eastern
coast of Spain, at St. Sebastian, and at Passages, were crowned
by the intrepidity with which the bar of the Adour was
crossed. Undaunted by the failure of the leading vessels,
which perished in the surf—with death before their eyes, and
their comrades swamping in the waters—on came the succeeding
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasse-marées</i>.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> At last the true channel was discovered.
Vessel succeeded vessel,—and before night a perfect bridge
was established over the Adour, able from its solidity to resist
a river current, and protected from any effort of the enemy
by a line of booms and spars, which stretched across the river
as a security against fire ships, or any other means which the
French might employ for its destruction<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
Before the flotilla had entered the Adour, or the pontoons
had arrived from Bedart, the guards attempted a passage of
the river by means of the small boats and a temporary raft
formed of a few pontoons, and worked as a flying bridge, by
means of a hawser extended from the opposite bank. As the
strength of the tide interrupted this precarious mode of passage,
when only six companies, with two of the 60th rifles,
and a party of the rocket corps, had crossed, the position of
this small body, isolated as it was, and open to the attack of
overwhelming numbers, was dangerous in the extreme.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a>
Colonel Stopford, however, made the best dispositions in his
power for defence, and formed with one flank upon the river,
and the other appuied upon a morass, while the heavy guns
that had been placed in battery on the other shore, swept the
ground in front of the position with their fire. As had been
truly apprehended, an attack was made. The French advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
with fifteen hundred men, and the guards and rifles received
them steadily—the rocket corps, on either flank, opening with
this novel and destructive projectile.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> A few discharges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
completely arrested the enemy’s advance, and they hastily
retired from the attack; while at the turning of the tide, reinforcements
were ferried over, and the position secured until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
the following evening, when the whole of the first division,
with two guns and a few troops of dragoons, succeeded in
effecting a passage.</p>

<p>Bayonne, in the mean time, was closely invested, and the
garrison forced back from the villages in front of their lines,
by Sir John Hope.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Lord Wellington, having secured the
attention of Soult by a formidable demonstration on his front,
enabled Sir Rowland Hill to pass the Gave de Oleron unopposed,
and thus turn the left flank of the French marshal.
Soult instantly retired and took a position behind the Pau,
establishing his head-quarters at Orthez. Picton, with the
third and light divisions, had followed Hill; Clinton, with the
sixth, had crossed between Laas and Montford; and Beresford
observed the enemy at Peyrehorade closely, and kept them
within their intrenchments.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington had decided on an immediate attack. The
French were very strongly posted—their left wing, commanded
by Clausel, rested on the Gave, and occupied the town of Orthez;
the centre, under d’Erlon, was formed on the heights in the
rear; while the right wing extended behind St. Boes, and held
that village. Harispe’s division was placed as a reserve in the
rear, and crossed the great roads leading to Bordeaux and
Toulouse.</p>

<p>On the 27th, Wellington commenced his operations. The
allied left wing, composed of the fourth and seventh divisions
and Vivian’s brigade, under Marshal Beresford, attacked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
enemy’s right at St. Boes; while the third and sixth divisions,
under Sir Rowland Hill, with Lord Edward Somerset’s light
cavalry, were directed against Soult’s left and centre. The
British movements were ably executed. Hill crossed the river
in front of the French left, and turned their flank—the enemy
holding their ground with great obstinacy, while the allied
attack was as remarkable for its impetuosity. A final and
protracted struggle ensued—but the French, unable to sustain
the combined assault of the allies, commenced retreating by
divisions, and contesting every inch of ground as they abandoned
it. Hill’s parallel march was speedily discovered—and
as that movement threatened their rear, the order of the retreat
was accelerated, and gradually assumed the character of a
flight. The British pressed rapidly forward—the French as
quickly fell back—both strove to gain Sault de Navailles—and
though charged by the English cavalry, the enemy crossed the
Luy de Bearne before Hill could succeed in coming up.</p>

<p>The defeat of the 27th was decisive. The French loss in
killed and wounded was immense. Six guns and a number of
prisoners were taken; the troops threw away their arms,—many
deserted altogether—and few defeats were marked by
more injurious results to the vanquished, than those attendant
upon that of Orthez.</p>

<p>The allied loss amounted to two hundred and seventy-seven
killed, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three wounded,
and seventy missing.</p>

<p>One circumstance occurred during this obstinate contest
that displayed the readiness of Lord Wellington’s decisions,
and the rapidity with which he adopted measures to meet
any incidental exigency.</p>

<p>A Portuguese battalion in advancing had been so roughly
received, that it broke and fell back upon a brigade of the
light division, who succeeded in covering its retreat. The
nature of the ground on which the right of the enemy was
posted, from its narrow front, confining the attack to a line of
but two battalions; while a heavy battery of guns and a converging
fire of musketry swept its approach and rendered the
boldest efforts of the assailants unavailing in carrying the
height. Wellington perceived the difficulty, and in a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
changed his method of attack. Walker, with the seventh
division, and Barnard, with a light brigade, were pushed up
the left of the height to attack the right of the French at its
point of junction with the centre; and Picton and Clinton
were directed to advance at once, and not as they had been
originally ordered, await the result of Beresford’s attempt upon
the hill. The whole face of the battle was thus suddenly
changed—the heights were speedily won—and the enemy, after
a fierce resistance, driven fairly from their ground, and forced
from a most formidable position.</p>

<p>That night the French retired to Hagetman—and, joined
by the garrison of Dax, fell back on St. Sever, and afterwards
on Agen—Beresford advancing by Mont de Marsan, and Hill
in the direction of Aire. Heavy rains favoured the French
retreat, by impeding the advance of the allies—and it was
the 2nd of March before Hill overtook them in front of Aire.</p>

<p>Although posted on formidable ground, Sir Rowland instantly
and successfully brought them to action. The second
division, with De Costa’s Portuguese, advanced to the attack;
the former by the road to Aire, and the latter by the heights
upon the left of the enemy. The movement of Stewart’s
division was most brilliant; and though the Portuguese behaved
gallantly and won the ridge, they were attacked
furiously, and unable to hold the ground, deforced, and driven
in great confusion from the height. The French followed with
a strong column, and the consequences threatened to be disastrous,
but the success of the second division permitted Sir
Rowland to detach Byng’s brigade to the assistance of De
Costa; and in place of assailing a broken corps, the enemy’s
columns were confronted by one in equal order, and already
buoyant with success. The result was what might have been
expected—the French were charged and beaten from the field—the
town and the position abandoned—the Adour hastily
crossed—a number of prisoners made, and a regiment cut off
and obliged to retire to Pau.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>Soult pursued the line of the right bank of the Adour, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
concentrated at Plaisance and Maubourget, to await Lord
Wellington’s attack—but finding the road to Bordeaux uncovered,
the allied general marched his left wing directly on
that city. On Beresford’s approach, the garrison evacuated
the place, crossing over to the right bank of the Garonne; and
the authorities and inhabitants generally assumed the white
cockade, and declared themselves in favour of the Bourbons.</p>

<h2 id="chap_40">TOULOUSE.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Termination of the conference of Chatillon.—Wellington determines to
reduce Bayonne.—Soult marches on Toulouse, and Wellington pursues
him.—Description of Toulouse.—Passage of the Garonne effected.—Battle
of Toulouse.—Subsequent events and movements.</p></blockquote>

<p>The celebrated conference at Chatillon terminated on the 19th
of March, and the allied Sovereigns determined to march
direct upon the capital, of which they obtained possession on
the 31st. The intelligence of this momentous event had not
reached the south of France—and Lord Wellington made
immense preparations to enable him to invest and reduce
Bayonne. Fascines and gabions were obtained in abundance—a
large supply of siege artillery, with shot and shells, was
landed at Passages from England—scaling-ladders were constructed
in the woods—the site of the batteries marked out—and
all was ready for an investment.</p>

<p>One division being considered sufficient for the protection
of Bordeaux, that city was intrusted to the care of Lord Dalhousie,
while Marshal Beresford was recalled, and joined the
army with the remainder of his corps.</p>

<p>Soult had manœuvred to draw the allies from Bordeaux;
and his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> occupied positions on the right bank of
the Adour, with advanced pickets in the town of Tarbes.</p>

<p>On the 20th of March, Hill’s division was directed to
attack the left wing of the enemy, after driving their outposts
from Tarbes—while Clinton, with the sixth division, and
Ponsonby and Lord Edward Somerset’s cavalry brigades,
should cross the river between Vic Bigorre and Rabastens,
and, by turning the right of the French, gain Soult’s rear.
To guard against this menaced attack, the French marshal
retired under cover of the night, and fell back upon Toulouse,
destroying the bridges as he passed them.</p>

<p>The unavoidable difficulty in crossing flooded rivers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
moving pontoons over roads nearly impassable from heavy
rains, delayed the allied march. Soult, therefore, reached
Toulouse in four days, while Wellington, by great exertion,
was only enabled to arrive before it in seven.</p>

<p>Toulouse stands on the right bank of the Garonne, which
separates it from a large suburb called Saint Cyprien. The
eastern and northern sides of the city are inclosed by the
canal of Languedoc, which joins the Garonne a mile below
the town. On the east of the city is the suburb of Saint
Etienne; on the south that of Saint Michael, and on that side
the great road from Carcassone and Montpellier enters the
town. The population was estimated at fifty thousand souls—and
it was generally understood that the inhabitants of
Toulouse were secretly attached to the Bourbons.</p>

<p>The city is walled and connected by ancient towers—but
these antiquated defences would avail little against the means
employed in modern warfare. Soult, therefore, intrenched
the fauxbourg of Saint Cyprien—constructed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">têtes du pont</i> at
all the bridges of the canal—threw up redoubts and breastworks,
and destroyed the bridges across the Ers. The
southern side he considered so secure as to require no additional
defences, trusting for its protection to the width and
rapidity of the Garonne.</p>

<p>The first attempt of the allied leader to throw a pontoon
bridge across the river, was rendered impracticable by the
sudden rising of its waters. Higher up, however, the passage
was effected, but the roads were quite impassable—and Lord
Wellington determined to lay the pontoons below the
city, which was accordingly done—and Beresford with the
fourth and sixth divisions, was safely placed upon the right
bank.</p>

<p>This temporary success might have been followed by disastrous
consequences. The Garonne suddenly increased—a
flood came pouring down—the swollen river momentarily rose
higher—and to save the pontoons from being swept away, the
bridge was removed, and the divisions left unsupported, with
an overpowering force in front, and an angry river in their
rear. Soult neglected this admirable opportunity of attacking
them; and on the second day the flood had sufficiently abated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
to allow the pontoons to be laid down again, when Frere’s
Spanish corps passed over, and reinforced the isolated divisions.
The bridge was now removed above the city, to facilitate
Hill’s communications, who, with the second division, was
posted in front of the fauxbourg of Saint Cyprien. The
passage of the third and light divisions was effected safely—and
Picton and Baron Alten took up ground with their
respective corps in front of the canal, and invested the northern
face of Toulouse.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 10th, the fortified heights on
the eastern front of the city were attacked. Soult had placed
all his disposable troops in this position—and thus defended,
nothing but determined gallantry on the part of the assailants
could expect success.</p>

<p>The bridge of Croix d’Orade, previously secured by a bold
attack of the 18th hussars, enabled Beresford and Frere to
move up the left bank of the Garonne, and occupy ground in
front of the heights preparatory to the grand attack. The
sixth division was in the centre, with the Spaniards on the
right, and the fourth British on the left. The cavalry of Sir
Stapleton Cotton and Lord Edward Somerset were formed
in support of the left and centre; and Arentchild, now in
command of Vivian’s brigade, was attached to the left flank,
while Ponsonby protected the right. The light division occupied
the vacant ground between the river Garonne and the
road to Croix d’Orade; its left abutting on the division
under Frere; and the third—its right resting on the river—communicated
with Hill’s corps upon the left by means
of the pontoon bridge. These divisions—those of Hill,
Picton, and Alten—were ordered to attack the enemy’s intrenchments
in front of their respective corps, simultaneously
with the grand assault upon the heights.</p>

<p>The fourth and sixth divisions moved obliquely against the
enemy’s right, carried the heights, and seized a redoubt on the
flank of the position; while the fourth Spanish corps, directed
against the ridge above the road to Croix d’Orade, advanced
with confidence, and succeeded in mounting the brow of the
hill. But the heavy fire of the French batteries arrested their
onward movement. They recoiled—became confused—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
sought shelter from the fury of the cannonade in a hollow
way in front of the enemy’s position.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> The French, perceiving
their disorder, advanced and vigorously charged. Frere
vainly endeavoured to rally his broken troops and lead them
on again; they were driven back confusedly on the Ers, and
their déroute appeared inevitable.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington saw and remedied this reverse. Personally,
he rallied a Spanish regiment, and bringing up a part of the
light division, arrested the French pursuit, and allowed the
broken regiments time to be re-organized. The bridge across
the Ers was saved—Frere reformed his battalions, and the
fugitives rejoined their colours.</p>

<p>Beresford immediately resumed the attack—two redoubts
were carried—and the sixth division dislodged the enemy,
and occupied the centre of their position. The contest here
was exceedingly severe—Pack, in leading the attack, was
wounded—and in an attempt to recover the heights by the
French, Taupin, who commanded the division, was killed.
Every succeeding effort failed—and the British held the
ground their gallantry had won.</p>

<p>Picton had most imprudently changed a false into a real
attack upon the bridge over the canal of Languedoc nearest
its entrance into the Garonne—but the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête du pont</i> was too
strong to be forced, and he fell back with considerable loss.
On the left, Sir Rowland Hill menaced the fauxbourg of Saint
Cyprien, and succeeded in fully occupying the attention of its
garrison, thus preventing them from rendering any assistance
when Soult was most severely pressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
In the mean time, Beresford having obtained his artillery,
resumed offensive movements, and advanced along the ridge
with the divisions of Cole and Clinton. Soult anticipated the
attack, and threw himself in front and flank in great force
upon the sixth division; but the effort failed. The French
marshal was driven from the hill—the redoubts abandoned—the
canal passed—and, beaten on every point, he sought refuge
within the walls of Toulouse.</p>

<p>Few victories cost more blood than this long and hard-contested
battle. The allied casualties, including two thousand
Spaniards, nearly extended to seven thousand men. Several
regiments lost half their number—and two, the 45th and 61st,
their colonels.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> It was impossible to ascertain the extent to
which the French suffered. Their loss was no doubt commensurate
with that of the victors. Of their superior officers
alone, two generals were killed, and three wounded and made
prisoners.</p>

<p>On the night of the succeeding day, Soult, alarmed by Wellingtons
movements on the road to Carcassone, retired from
the city, which next morning was taken possession of by the
allies, although the French unblushingly assert that they
gained a victory.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
There was seldom a bloodier, and never a more useless battle
fought than that of the 10th of March—for on the evening of
the 12th, an English and French field officer, Colonels Cooke
and St. Simon, arrived at the allied head-quarters, with intelligence
that, on the 3rd hostilities had ceased, and the war
was virtually terminated. A courier, despatched from the
capital with this important communication, had been unfortunately
interrupted in his journey; and in ignorance of passing
events, the contending armies wasted their best energies, and
lost many of the bravest on both sides, in a bootless and unnecessary
encounter.</p>

<p>Soult, on having the abdication of Napoleon formally notified
to him on the night of the 13th, refused to send in his
adherence to the Bourbons, merely offering a suspension of
hostilities, to which Lord Wellington most properly objecting,
instantly recommenced his pursuit of the French marshal’s
beaten divisions. The advance, however, was not continued.
Soult acknowledged the provisional government—and a line
of demarcation was drawn between the allied troops and those
of the Duke of Dalmatia.</p>

<p>An unnecessary expenditure of human life cannot be regarded
without deep regret, bordering upon abhorrence. Surely
enough of blood had been shed uselessly at Toulouse,<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> but it
was destined that more should flow.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="chap_41">SORTIE OF BAYONNE.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Bayonne invested.—Sortie on the night of the 13th.—Thouvenot driven
back.—Wellington advances.—Soult sends in his adherence to the Provisional
Government.—Wellington visits Paris and Madrid. The army
returns to England.—Duke of Wellington takes his seat in the House
of Peers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The British and French officers having passed through Bordeaux,
forwarded a hurried notification to Sir John Hope, announcing
the termination of hostilities; but, unfortunately, no
accredited person was despatched. Of course, Sir John
waited for orders from Lord Wellington; but he communicated
the important intelligence he had received to the French
outposts—and as the siege guns had not arrived, no jealousy
should have been entertained by Thouvenot, who commanded
the garrison of Bayonne.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Like Soult at Toulouse, that general,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
however, wantonly provoked an affair, from which no
glory resulted to himself, and much blood was unnecessarily
wasted.</p>

<p>On the night of the 13th, two deserters came over to the
allied outposts, and gave information that the whole of the
garrison were under arms, and prepared to make a sortie
early on the following morning. At three o’clock the British
regiments were formed and ready to receive the enemy—and
a false attack was presently made on the outposts in front of
Anglez. In the darkness, which was intense, the firing was
too apparent in its feebleness, not to betray that the attempt
was but a feint, and intended only to mask a more determined
effort. The true attack was speedily made. The allied
pickets in front of the citadel were partially surprised—and,
rushing forward, two French columns with their customary
impetuosity broke through the line of outposts stationed between
St. Etienne and St. Bernard, while another powerful
column moved upon the former village, and the whole line of
pickets on the right bank of the river became seriously
engaged.</p>

<p>A deep hollow way leads through St. Etienne, inclosed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
some places by high banks, and at others by garden walls.
The ground about St. Etienne is everywhere confined, and the
communications are few and difficult. Hence, when the advanced
line was broken, many of the pickets were totally cut
off. In their attempts to retire, several murderous affairs
ensued—when finding themselves desperately situated, they
resorted to as desperate means. Some fought their way
through, and succeeded in escaping—more, however, perished
in the attempt,—and heaps of dead, both French and English,
lay crowded together in spaces of little extent, and the bayonet
wounds by which they had mutually perished, betrayed the
ferocity with which the British had resisted to the last.</p>

<p>As it might be naturally supposed that the grand object of
the sortie would be the destruction of the bridge of vessels over
the Adour, Lord Saltoun placed himself in readiness to repel
the expected attack, and occupied in force the convent of
St. Bernard, which he had already strongly fortified. The first
division, moved forward to support the picket, was cannonaded
by the French gun-boats, which dropping down the
river had covered the sortie. The enemy came forward in
imposing numbers—the whole of the village of St. Etienne
fell into their hands—and while giving orders for the defence
of some important buildings, Major-general Hay was unfortunately
killed.</p>

<p>On the first alarm, Sir John Hope, with his staff, hastened
towards St. Etienne—and not aware that the village was already
in possession of the enemy, and that his pickets had
retired, he entered the hollow road as the shortest way to
reach the scene of action. In a few minutes the enemy’s
column was discovered in the feeble light, and the general
wheeled round to extricate himself from the threatened danger
of being taken. It was now too late—the French infantry
hurried on, and commenced firing within a dozen yards—Sir
John’s horse was killed, and falling on his leg prevented him
from rising. Two of his staff dismounted to assist him, but
they too were severely wounded, and rendered unable to relieve
the general—and the whole fell into the hands of the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
Sir John was immediately hurried to Bayonne, and on the
road was again wounded in the foot by a shot from the English
pickets. Other prisoners, of lesser note, had fallen into the
hands of the French, during the darkness and confusion incident
on a night attack—among these was Colonel Townshend,
who commanded the pickets of the Guards.</p>

<p>The first brigade of Guards was now desired to support the
right flank, and the second directed to recover the ground that
lay between it and the village of St. Etienne. Finding the
attack confined to the centre of the British lines immediately
in front of the citadel, the third battalion of the Guards was
detached, under Colonel Stuart, to regain the hollow road, and
drive the enemy from the fields in its rear.</p>

<p>These attempts were finally successful. The Coldstream
and first Foot Guards rushed forward on opposite flanks,
cheering loudly as they charged—and the French, alarmed
lest they should be cut off from Bayonne, rapidly retired over
the glacis of the citadel, suffering considerable loss<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> from the
musketry of their pursuers.</p>

<p>The contest at St. Etienne had been maintained with great
obstinacy. A company of the 38th, commanded by Captain
Forster, occupied and held a house in that village, against
every effort the enemy made to dispossess them. The little
garrison were sadly reduced, when a brigade of Germans
under General Hinuber, recovered the village, and saved the
remnant of the gallant band.</p>

<p>A night attack is always attended by an awful grandeur
that it is almost impossible to imagine or describe—and, in
effect, nothing could exceed the sortie from the citadel of
Bayonne. The deeper flashes of the cannon, the sparkling of
the musketry, the sudden bursting of the shells, after describing
curves of light in their transit,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> and the brilliant illumination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
occasionally produced by the fire-balls thrown from
the fortress to direct the range of its artillery, were singularly
contrasted with the darkness of the night, which, after these
brief and brilliant displays, appeared gloomier and denser than
before. Presently, a fascine depôt became ignited by the
bursting of a shell, and several houses at the same time caught
fire and burned furiously, throwing a lurid glare over a field
on which death was busy. To complete this fearful picture,
the thunder of one hundred guns, and the bursting of shells,
united with the cheering of the combatants and the cries of
the wounded—all, in point of horror, rendering it, as a scene
of slaughter, perfect.</p>

<p>On both sides the sortie of Bayonne entailed a deplorable
loss of life.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> Independent of prisoners, the British numbered
fully five hundred killed and wounded, while the French loss
was estimated at eight hundred and fifty. Several superior
officers fell—and a great number of subordinate rank were
reckoned among the killed and wounded.</p>

<p>“Towards the close of the action, the moon had risen, and
as dawn broke over the scene of battle, a spectator could discern
the dreadful havoc that had been made. The French
and English soldiers and officers were lying on all sides, either
killed or wounded; and so intermixed were they, that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
appeared to have been no distinct line belonging to either
party.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p>The command of the left wing devolved on Major-General
Colville, and the rival armies continued to observe each other
with the most jealous vigilance.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington never relaxed his active movements; and
Soult having refused to acknowledge the provisional government,
the allied commander advanced. The bold and decisive
measures of the allied leader doubtless hastened the Duke of
Dalmatia in making his decision—and, on the arrival of a
second official communication, Soult notified his adherence, and
hostilities ceased. Suchet had already shewn him the example—and
Toulouse displayed the white flag. A line of demarcation
was made by commissioners between the rival
armies, and a regular convention signed by the respective
commanders.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> On the 27th, Thouvenot was instructed by
Soult to surcease hostilities, and acknowledge the Bourbons—the
lilies floated over the citadel—and saluted by three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
hundred rounds of artillery, Napoleon’s abdication, and the
restoration of the Bourbons, were formally announced.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
In the north of France, Napoleon’s downfal had been hurrying
rapidly to its close. The congress at Chatillon finally
concluded its sittings on the 19th of March—and on the next
day, Buonaparte was severely repulsed in a general engagement
with the allies at Arcis. Even the repeated reverses he
had latterly endured, could not extinguish that audacity of
action for which the French emperor was so remarkable.
With a ruined army, he threw himself behind the Marne on
the 22nd, regardless of the enormous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> collected
in his front, and whose numbers were quite adequate to crush
a force like his, weakened by defeat, and disheartened by the
defection of the southern provinces. Directing his march on
St. Dizier, he declared “that he should reach Vienna before
the allies entered Paris.” If this mad project were devised
only to interrupt their advance on the French capital, it failed
entirely,—the allied corps marched steadily on Paris—Marmont
and Mortier were driven back upon that city—and the
capital was regularly invested on the 29th.</p>

<p>Affairs had now reached a crisis. To defend that city with
a corps not mustering twenty thousand men, would have been,
with every assistance attainable from the inhabitants and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gendarmerie</i>,
an act of madness. On the 30th, the allies carried
the heights of Bellevue. The marshals retired—Joseph, the
ex-King of Spain, quitted the capital—and the city, evacuated
by the regular troops, capitulated.</p>

<p>Failing in his efforts at distracting the allied generals in
their advance, Napoleon, after a smart affair, decided to
countermarch on Paris—but the Prussian corps, that held
Vitry, completely barred the direct line of march, and obliged
him to take a circuitous rout. Having put his army again
into motion, Buonaparte travelled post, and when within four
leagues of Paris, learned that his capital was actually in possession
of the allies. After much indecision he determined,
with what troops he could collect, to march from Fontainbleau
to Paris, on the 3rd of April. But his history had been already
politically closed by a decree passed on the preceding
day by the conservative senate. His deposition was solemnly
pronounced—the soldiery liberated from their allegiance—all
confidence, civil and military, was destroyed—and a throne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
erected on the ruins of kingdoms, and cemented by seas of
blood, crumbled into nothingness, and,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Like the baseless fabric of a vision,<br /></span>
<span class="iq">Left not a wreck behind.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>With political events we have no business, and it is sufficient
to cursorily observe, that arrangements were effected for
Napoleon’s retirement from public life to the “lonely isle,”
where he might still, in fancy, “call himself a king.” To this
secluded spot, many of his old and devoted followers accompanied
him. Peace was generally proclaimed over Europe;
tranquillity restored in France; the “Grand Nation,” to all
appearance, contented itself with the change of government;
the allied sovereigns retired with their respective corps, each
to his own dominions; and the victorious army of Wellington
quitted the French soil, on which it had consummated its
glory; and received, on landing on the shores of Britain, that
enthusiastic welcome which its “high deeds” and boundless
gallantry deserved from a grateful country.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>Lord Wellington quitted Toulouse on the night of the 30th
of April, and reached Paris safely on the morning of the 4th
of May. His reception by the restored monarch and the
allied sovereigns was most gratifying—for none had done so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
much for the deliverance of Europe;—none, when all beside,
with few exceptions, “blanched from the helm,” so fearlessly
persevered, regardless of disheartening abandonment abroad
and more evil auguries at home. Advanced to a dukedom,
the allied general had gained every honour to which a British
subject was admissible—while every court in Europe had already
marked their admiration and respect, by presenting to
the Liberator of Spain the insignia of the highest orders at
their disposition.</p>

<p>The flattering reception bestowed upon the English duke
in the French capital detained him but a brief space from his
high command. He left Paris on the 10th—hurried to Toulouse—arranged
every thing for a short absence—and hastened
to Madrid to welcome the deposed monarch, who, through his
instrumentality, had been replaced upon the throne. The
honours already conferred upon the duke by the provisional
government were confirmed by Ferdinand, and the rank of
Captain-General of Spain added to the rest. On the 5th of
June he quitted Madrid—reached head-quarters on the 10th,—reviewed
those splendid divisions to whom so often he had
pointed out the path of victory,—and, in a modest and plainly-written
order, bade his companions in arms farewell<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a>—and
returned to England “the admired” of his own, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
“envied one” of his opponents. His general order was dated
the 14th of June,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> and on the 23rd he landed at Dover and
proceeded to the capital.</p>

<p>It is a singular, and, we believe, an unprecedented occurrence,
that when presented to the House of Lords, four patents
of nobility, namely, those of Viscount, Earl, Marquis, and
Duke, were severally read, when, for the first time, Wellington

QUATRE BRAS.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Napoleon’s return.—His enthusiastic reception.—Makes mighty efforts
to restore the military power of France.—Duke of Wellington arrives
in Brussels, and takes the command of the allies.—Belgium.—Napoleon
leaves Paris.—Drives in the Prussian outposts.—Ney attacks the Prince
of Orange.—Wellington marches to his assistance.—Battle of Quatre
Bras.</p></blockquote>

<p>A few months passed away—Europe was apparently at rest—its
military attitude was gradually softening down—and all
the belligerent powers, weary of a state of warfare that, with
slight intermission, had lasted for a quarter of a century,
enjoyed the repose which the overthrow of Napoleon’s power
had produced. But this state of quietude was delusory—it
was the treacherous calm that precedes a tempest. Untamed
by adversity, that ambitious spirit was gathering strength for
another effort—France was ready to receive him—past victories
would thus be rendered useless—Europe convulsed again—and
none could foresee what strange events the descent of
Napoleon might produce.</p>

<p>No recorded career parallels that of Napoleon Buonaparte;
and in the history of kings and conquerors, the strangest story
was his own. He seemed the shuttlecock of Fortune—and
she placed him “on a pinnacle of pride merely to mark her
own mutability.” Hurled from the sovereignty of half the
world, his star had lost its ascendancy, apparently to rise no
more,—when, by the happiest accident, his voyage from Elba
was uninterrupted<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a>—his landing unopposed—an enthusiastic
welcome everywhere was given to the intruder—legions congregated
at his bidding—the empire was offered and accepted—and
the first intelligence of his descent was closely followed by a
formal acknowledgment of his restoration to the sovereignty
of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
Napoleon landed in the Var on the 1st of March, and on
the 19th he slept in the palace of Fontainbleau. Louis had
abandoned the capital, and in a few hours the dynasty of the
Bourbons seemed forgotten. None opposed the return of the
exile—his decrees were absolute, his wishes were anticipated.
The splendour of military parade delighted the soldiery, while
the theatric glitter of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">champ de Mai</i> was admirably
adapted to catch the fancies, and win the momentary attachment
of a gay and thoughtless people. The whole pageant,
in scenic effect, was suited for those whom it was designed to
lure—and on the 17th of April, Napoleon was formally
restored to that empire, from which the same “sweet voices”
had, but a few months before, so formally deposed him.</p>

<p>Parisian adulation, and the military devotion he received
from the moment his foot touched the shore at Cannes, did not
blind him to “coming events.” A vain effort to make terms
with the allied powers was scornfully rejected. At Vienna,
his overtures were treated with disdain, and his letter to the
English regent was returned with the seal unbroken. He
saw from all these premonitory occurrences, that a storm was
about to burst, and lost no time in preparing for a determined
resistance. A powerful army alone could avert the danger—and,
with his customary tact, Napoleon made prodigious
efforts to restore the military strength of the empire, which the
Russian, German, and Peninsular campaigns had during the
last years so miserably weakened.</p>

<p>French vanity was successfully appealed to—the memory
of past victories recalled—and martial glory, that powerful
touchstone of national feeling, successfully employed to win
the people to his standard. The younger of the male
population were called out by ordonnances, and the retired
veterans collected once more around those eagles, which,
in prouder days, had entered half the European capitals in
triumph.</p>

<p>The military power of France was organized anew. Commissioners,
specially employed, enforced the operations of
Napoleon’s decrees in every department of the kingdom.
The Imperial Guard was re-established—the cavalry increased
and remounted—that powerful arm, the artillery, by which
half the victories of the French army had been achieved, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
enlarged and improved—and, in a time inconceivably short, a
most splendid <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i>, perfect in every department, was
ready for the field.</p>

<p>While Napoleon was thus engaged, Wellington, having
signed on behalf of the Prince Regent the treaty of Vienna,
arrived at Brussels on the 5th of April, to take command of
the British army. There, the troops of the Prince of the
Netherlands, with those of Nassau and Brunswick, were
placed under his orders—the whole forming the Anglo-Belgic
army.</p>

<p>The Prussian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> were cantoned in and about
Namur and Charleroi—while Ostend, Antwerp, Tournay,
Ypres, Mons, and Ghent, were occupied by the allies. The
position of the Anglo-Belgic army was extended and detached—for
the preceding harvest in the Low Countries had been
unusually deficient; and of course, the British and Belgic
cantonments covered an additional surface to obtain the requisite
supplies.</p>

<p>The allied corps in June were thus disposed. Lord Hill,
with the right wing, occupied Ath. The left, under the
Prince of Orange, was posted at Braine-le-Comte and Nivelles.
The cavalry, under the Marquis of Anglesea, were established
round Grammont; and the reserve and head-quarters, under
the duke, were quartered in Brussels.</p>

<p>Belgium, for centuries, had been the seat of war—and every
plain, every fortress, had its tale of martial achievement to
narrate. Within its iron frontier there were few places which
had not witnessed some affair of arms—the whole country
was rife with military reminiscences—and it was destined to
prove the scene where the greatest event in modern warfare
should be transacted. As a country, Belgium was admirably
adapted for martial operations—the plains, in many places
extensive, terminated in undulated ridges or bolder heights;
while the surface generally admitted the movements of masses
of infantry. Canals, rivers, morasses, and villages, presented
favourable positions to abide a battle, and difficult ones
for an advancing army to force—while the fortresses everywhere
offered facilities for retiring upon,—and presented
serious obstacles to those who must mask or carry them when
advancing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
To a commander circumstanced like Wellington, great perplexity,
as to the distribution of his army, must arise—for the
mode and point of Napoleon’s attack were alike involved in
mystery. He might decide on adopting a defensive war, and
permit the allies to become the assailants. This course, however,
was not a probable one—but where he would precipitate
himself was the difficulty. He was already in great force
around Maubeuge and Binch, and consequently, Nivelles and
Charleroi were equally exposed to aggression. On the right,
he might attack Namur with Girard’s corps; or, with
D’Erlon’s, advance on Courtrai by Lille; while leaving the
wood of Soignies on his right, he could reach Brussels by
Mons and Braine-le-Comte, thus gaining the rear of the
allies, and favouring an insurrectionary movement of the
Belgians—an event on which he placed considerable reliance.
All these movements were open to Napoleon—and had he
adopted others than he did at the opening of the campaign, that
more fortunate results would have attended them, are now subjects
only for military speculation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after leaving Paris on the 12th, and inspecting
Laon as he passed, he reached Avennes on the 14th. The
respective corps had moved instantaneously from their cantonments,
and with admirable precision united themselves on the
Belgic frontier, and to them Napoleon issued his celebrated
address. A slight change of the poet’s words would best
describe <span class="locked">it—</span></p>

<p class="center">“It was his <em>boldest</em> and his last!”</p>

<p>The dangerous proximity of Brussels to the point where
Napoleon’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> were concentrating, naturally produced
an anxious inquietude among the inhabitants and visitants.
The city was filled every hour with idle rumours, but
time alone could develope Napoleon’s plans.</p>

<p>The first intelligence of a threatening movement on the part
of the French emperor was forwarded to the Duke of Wellington,
when Blucher learned that Zeithen’s corps was
attacked. The despatch reached Brussels at half-past four—but,
as it merely intimated that the Prussian outposts had been
driven back, the information was not of sufficient importance
to induce the British commander to make any change in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
cantonments of the allied army. Nothing, in fact, could have
been more masterly than the manner in which the different
corps were disposed. From necessity, they were extended
over a large surface—but still, they were so stationed as to
admit a concentration of the whole within four-and-twenty
hours, or a junction with the Prussian right, should a flank
movement be found desirable.</p>

<p>A second despatch reached the duke at midnight, and its
intelligence was more decisive than the former. Napoleon
was across the Sambre, and in full march on Charleroi and
Fleurus. Orders were instantly issued for the more detached
corps to break up from their cantonments and advance upon
Nivelles, while the troops in Brussels should march direct by
the forest of Soignies, on Charleroi. Thus there would be a
simultaneous reunion of the brigades as they approached the
scene of action, while their communication with the Prussian
right should be carefully secured.</p>

<p>Blucher’s second despatch was delivered to the British general
in the ball-room of the Duchess of Richmond. That
circumstance most probably gave rise to the groundless report
that Wellington and the Prussian marshal were surprised—but
nothing could be more absurd than this supposition. Both
commanders were in close and constant communication, and
their plans for mutual co-operation were amply matured.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
Where the intended attack—if Napoleon would indeed venture
to become aggressor—should be made, was an uncertainty,—and
it had been arranged, that if Blucher were assailed,
Wellington should move to his assistance, or, in the
event of the British being the first object with Napoleon, then
the Prussian marshal should sustain the duke with a corps,
or with his whole army, were that found necessary. Nothing
could be more perfect than the cordial understanding between
the allied commanders—and the result proved how faithfully
these mutual promises of support were realized.</p>

<p>A defensive war was better suited to the military resources
of France, and more likely to excite national spirit, than a forward
movement; but still, with his characteristic daring,
keeping the Prussians for a time in check, Napoleon might
penetrate to Brussels by the road of Charleroi. It would
have been undoubtedly a dangerous experiment—but circumstanced
as he was, even with one hundred thousand Prussians
on his flank, it was not improbable that the trial would be
hazarded.</p>

<p>Two hours after midnight, the gaiety of “fair Brussels”
closed—the drums beat to arms, and all was hurry and preparation.
Momentarily the din increased, “and louder yet
the clamour grew,” as the Highland pibroch answered the
bugle-call of the light infantry.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> The soldiery, startled from
their sleep, poured out from the now deserted dwellings; and
the once peaceful city exhibited a general alarm.</p>

<p>The sun rose on a scene of confusion and excitement. The
military assembled in the Place Royale; and the difference of
individual character might be traced in the respective bearings
of the various soldiery. Some were taking a tender—many,
a last leave of wives and children—others, stretched upon the
pavement, were listlessly waiting for their comrades to come
up—while not a few strove to snatch a few moments of repose,
and appeared half insensible to the din of war around them.
Waggons were loading and artillery harnessing; orderlies and
aides-de-camp rode rapidly through the streets; and in the
gloom of early morning the pavement sparkled beneath the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
iron feet of the cavalry, as they hurried along the causeway
to join their respective squadrons, which were now collecting
in the Park.</p>

<p>The appearance of the British brigades as they filed from
the Park and took the road to Soignies, was most imposing.
The martial air of the Highland regiments, the bagpipes playing
at their head, their tartans fluttering in the breeze, and the
early sunbeams flashing from their glittering arms, excited the
admiration of the burghers who had assembled to see them
march. During the winter and spring, while they had garrisoned
Brussels, their excellent conduct and gentle demeanour
had endeared them to the inhabitants; and “they were so
domesticated in the houses where they were quartered, that it
was no uncommon thing to see the Highland soldier taking
care of the children, or keeping the shop of his host.”<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Regiment
after regiment marched—the organization of all most
perfect:—the Rifles, Royals, 28th—each exhibiting some
martial peculiarity, on which the eye of Picton appeared to
dwell with pride and pleasure as they filed off before him. To
an intelligent spectator a national distinction was clearly
marked. The bearing of the Scotch bespoke a grave and firm
determination—while the light step and merry glance of the
Irish militiaman told that war was the game he loved, and a
first field had no terrors for him.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock pealed from the steeple clocks; all was quiet—the
brigades, with their artillery and equipages, were gone—the
crash of music was heard no longer—the bustle of preparation
had ceased—and an ominous and heart-sinking silence
succeeded the noise and hurry that ever attends a departure
for the field of battle.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s plan of penetrating into Belgium<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> was now so
clearly ascertained, that Wellington determined to concentrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
on the extreme point of his line of occupation. His march
was accordingly directed on Quatre Bras, a small hamlet
situated at the intersection of the road to Charleroi, by that
leading from Namur to Nivelles.</p>

<p>This village, which was fated to obtain a glorious but sanguinary
celebrity, consists of a few mean houses, having a
thick and extensive wood immediately on the right called Le
Bois de Bossu. All around the wood and hamlet, rye-fields
of enormous growth, and quite ready for the sickle, were
extended.</p>

<p>After a distressing march of twenty miles in sultry weather
and over a country destitute of water, the British brigades
reached the scene of action at two o’clock. They found the
Prince of Orange with a division of his army endeavouring to
hold the French in check, and maintain a position of whose great
importance he was so well aware. The prince, unable to withstand
the physical superiority of Ney’s corps, had gradually
lost ground—the Hanoverians had been driven back—and the
Bois de Bossu was won and occupied by the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p>To recover this most important wood, from which the French
could debouche upon the road to Brussels, was the duke’s first
object. The 95th were ordered to attack the tirailleurs who
held it; the order was gallantly executed, and after a bloody
and sustained resistance the French were forced to retire.</p>

<p>On the left, the Royals and 28th were hotly engaged, and
on the right the 44th and Highland regiments were simultaneously
assailed. The battle now became general. Before
the British could deploy, the French cavalry charged furiously—the
tall rye masking their advance and favouring the
attack. Generally these charges were unsuccessful—and the
perfect discipline and steady courage of the English enabled
them to repel the enemy. Lancers and cuirassiers were driven
back with desperate slaughter—while whole squadrons, shattered
in their retreat, and leaving the ground covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
their dead and dying, proved with what fatal precision the
British squares sustained their fusilade.</p>

<p>The efforts of the French to break the squares, however,
were fierce and frequent. Their batteries poured upon these
unflinching soldiers a storm of grape—and when an opening
was made by the cannon, the lancers were ready to rush upon
the devoted infantry. But nothing could daunt the lion-hearted
English—nothing could shake their steadiness. The
dead were coolly removed, and the living occupied their places.
Though numbers fell, and the square momentarily diminished,
it still presented a serried line of glittering bayonets, through
which lancer and cuirassier endeavoured to penetrate—but in
vain.</p>

<p>“One regiment, after sustaining a furious cannonade, was
suddenly, and on three different sides, assailed by cavalry.
Two faces of the square were charged by the lancers, while
the cuirassiers galloped down upon another. It was a trying
moment. There was a death-like silence; and one voice alone,
clear and calm, was heard. It was their colonel’s, who called
upon them to be ‘steady.’ On came the enemy!—the earth
shook beneath the horsemen’s feet; while on every side of the
devoted band, the corn bending beneath the rush of cavalry
disclosed their numerous assailants. The lance blades nearly
met the bayonets of the kneeling front rank—the cuirassiers
were within a few paces—yet not a trigger was drawn. But,
when the word ‘fire!’ thundered from the colonel’s lips, each
side poured out its deadly volley—and in a moment the leading
files of the French lay before the square, as if hurled by
a thunderbolt to the earth. The assailants, broken and dispersed,
galloped off for shelter to the tall rye, while a constant
stream of musketry from the British square, carried death into
their retreating squadrons.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<p>But, unhappily, these furious and continued charges were
not always inefficient. On the right, and in the act of forming
square, the 42nd were attacked by the lancers. The sudden
rush, and the difficulty of forming in corn reaching to the
shoulder, gave a temporary success to the assailants. Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
companies, excluded from the square, were ridden over and
cut down. The colonel was killed—half the regiment disabled—but
the remainder formed and repulsed the charge;
while those detached in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i> fought back to back
with desperate coolness, until the withering fusilade of their
companions dispersed the cavalry, and enabled them to rejoin
their ranks.</p>

<p>The remaining regiments of the Highland brigade were
hotly pressed by the enemy; they had not a moment’s respite;
for no sooner were the lancers and cuirassiers driven back,
than the French batteries opened with a torrent of grape upon
the harassed squares, which threatened to overwhelm them.
Numbers of officers and men were already stretched upon the
field, while the French, reinforced by fresh columns, redoubled
their exertions, while the brave and devoted handful
of British troops seemed destined to cover with their bodies
that ground their gallantry scorned to surrender. Wellington,
as he witnessed the slaughter of his best troops, is said to
have been deeply affected; and repeated references to his
watch, showed how anxiously he waited for reinforcements.</p>

<p>The Bois de Bossu had continued to be the scene of a severe
and fluctuating combat. The 95th had driven the French
out—but under a heavy cannonade, and supported by a cavalry
movement, the rifles were overpowered by numbers and forced
to retire, fighting inch by inch, and contesting every tree.
Ney established himself at last within the wood—and ordered
up a considerable addition to the light troops, who had already
occupied this important point of the position.</p>

<p>The contest was at its height. The incessant assaults of
the enemy were wasting the British regiments, but, with the
exception of the Bois de Bossu, not an inch of ground was lost.
The men were falling in hundreds—death was busy everywhere—but
not a cheek blanched, and not a foot receded!
The courage of these undaunted soldiers needed no incitement—but
on the contrary, the efforts of their officers were constantly
required to restrain the burning ardour that would, if
unrepressed, have led to ruinous results. Maddened to see
their ranks thinned by renewed assaults which they were
merely suffered to repel, they panted for the hour of action.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
The hot blood of Erin was boiling for revenge—and even the
cool endurance of the Scotch began to yield, and a murmur
was sometimes heard of, “Why are we not led forward?”</p>

<p>And yet, though forward movements were denied them, the
assailants paid dearly for this waste of British blood. For a
long hour, the 92nd had been exposed to a destructive fire
from the French artillery that occasioned a fearful loss. A
regiment of Brunswick cavalry had attempted to repel a charge
of cuirassiers, and repulsed with loss, were driven back upon
the Highlanders in great disorder. The hussars galloped
down a road on which part of the regiment was obliqued—the
remainder lining the ditch in front. The rear of the Brunswickers
intermingled with the headmost of the French horsemen,
and for a while, the 92nd could not relieve them with
their musketry. At last the pursuers and pursued rode rapidly
past the right flank of the Highlanders, and permitted them
to deliver their volley. The word “fire!” was scarcely given,
when the close and converged discharge of both wings fell,
with terrible effect, upon the advanced squadron. The cuirassiers
were literally cut down by that withering discharge, and
the road choked up with men and horses rolling in dying agony—while
the shattered remnant of what but a few moments
before had been a splendid regiment, retreated in desperate
confusion to avoid a repetition of that murderous fusilade.</p>

<p>At this period of the battle, the guards, after a march of
seven-and-twenty miles, arrived from Enghein, from whence
they had moved at three in the morning. Exhausted by heat
and fatigue, they halted at Nivelles, lighted fires, and prepared
to cook their dinners. But the increasing roar of cannon
announced that the duke was seriously engaged, and a staff
officer brought orders to hurry on. The bivouac was instantly
broken up—the kettles packed—the rations abandoned—and
the wearied troops cheerfully resumed their march.</p>

<p>The path to the field of battle could not be mistaken; the
roar of cannon was succeeded by the roll of musketry, which
at every step became more clearly audible; and waggons,
heaped with wounded British and Brunswickers interspersed,
told that the work of death was going on.</p>

<p>The Guards, indeed, came up at a fortunate crisis. The
Bois de Bossu was won; and the tirailleurs of the enemy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
debouching from its cover, were about to deploy upon the
roads that it commanded, and would thus intercept the duke’s
communication with the Prussians. The fifth division, sadly
reduced, could hardly hold their ground—any offensive movement
was impracticable—and the French tirailleurs were actually
issuing from the wood—but on perceiving the advancing
columns, they halted. The first brigade of Guards, having
loaded and fixed bayonets, were ordered to advance—and,
wearied as they were with a fifteen hours’ march, they cheered,
and pushed forward.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> In vain the thick trees impeded them—and
although every bush and coppice was held and disputed
by the enemy, the tirailleurs were driven in on every side.
Taking advantage of a rivulet which crossed the wood, the
enemy attempted to form and arrest the progress of the Guards.
That stand was momentary—they were forced from their
position, and the wood once more was carried by the British.</p>

<p>Their success was, however, limited to its occupation; the
broken ground and close timber prevented the battalion from
forming; and when it emerged, and of course in considerable
disorder—from its cover, the masses of cavalry drawn up in the
open ground charged and forced it back. At last, after many
daring attempts to debouch and form, the first brigade fell
back upon the third battalion, which, by flanking the wood,
had been enabled to form square, and repulse the cavalry, and
there the brigade halted. Evening was now closing in—the
attacks of the enemy became fewer and feebler—a brigade of
heavy cavalry with horse artillery came up—and, worn out by
the sanguinary struggle of six long hours, the assailants ceased
their attack—and the fifth and third divisions took a position
for the night upon the ground their unbounded heroism had
held through this long and bloody day.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the fight of Quatre Bras—and a more
glorious victory was never won by British bravery. Night
closed the battle—and when the limited number of the allied
troops actually engaged is considered, this sanguinary conflict
will stand almost without a parallel. At the opening of the
action at half-past two, the Duke’s force could not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
exceeded sixteen thousand—his whole cavalry consisting of
some Brunswick hussars, supported by a few Belgian and
Hanoverian guns—and the great distance of their cantonments
from the field of battle prevented the British cavalry and
horse artillery arriving until late in the evening. Vivian’s
brigade (1st Hanoverian, and 10th and 18th hussars) came up
at seven o’clock—but the rest only reached Quatre Bras at the
close of the action, having made a forced march from behind
the Dender, over bad roads for more than forty miles. Ney,
by his own account, commenced the battle with the second
corps and Excelman’s cavalry—the former numbering thirty
thousand, strong in artillery, and its cavalry, that of the second
corps included, amounting to three thousand six hundred.
The French marshal complains that the first corps, originally
assigned to him, and which he had left at Frasnes in reserve,
had been withdrawn by Napoleon without any intimation, and
never employed during the entire day—and thus, as Ney
writes to Fouche, “twenty-five or thirty thousand men were,
I may say, paralyzed, and idly paraded during the battle,
from the right to the left, and the left to the right, without
firing a shot.” All this admitted, surely his means were amply
sufficient to have warranted a certain victory? In numbers
his cavalry were infinitely superior—his artillery was equally
powerful—while in those important arms, Wellington was
miserably weak—and all he had to oppose to his stronger
antagonist, were the splendid discipline and indomitable courage
of British infantry.</p>

<p>The loss sustained by the British and their allies in this
glorious and hard-contested battle amounted to three thousand
seven hundred and fifty, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. Of course, the
British suffered most severely, having three hundred and
twenty men killed, and two thousand one hundred and
fifty-five wounded. The Duke of Brunswick fell in the act of
rallying his troops, and an immense number of British officers
were found among the slain and wounded. During an
advanced movement, the 92nd, while repulsing an attack of
both cavalry and infantry, met a French column, retreating
to the wood, which halted and turned its fire on the Highlanders,
already assailed by a superior force. Notwithstanding,
the regiment bravely held its ground until relieved by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
regiment of the Guards, when it retired to its original position.
In this brief and sanguinary conflict, its loss amounted to
twenty-eight officers, and nearly three hundred men.</p>

<p>The casualties, when compared with the number of the
combatants, will appear enormous. Most of the battalions
lost their commanding officers—and the rapid succession of
subordinate officers on whom the command devolved, told how
fast the work of death went on. Trifling wounds were disregarded—and
men, severely hurt, refused to retire to the rear,
or rejoined their colours after a temporary dressing. Picton’s
was a remarkable instance of this disregard of suffering; he
was severely wounded at Quatre Bras, and the fact was only
ascertained after his glorious fall at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The French loss, according to their own returns, was “very
considerable, amounting to four thousand two hundred killed or
wounded; and Ney in his report says, “I was obliged to
renounce my hopes of victory; and in spite of all my efforts,
in spite of the intrepidity and devotion of my troops, my
utmost efforts could only maintain me in my position till the
close of the day.”</p>

<p>“Ney fell back upon the road to Frasnes. The moon rose
angrily—still a few cannon-shot were heard after the day had
departed; but gradually they ceased. The fires were lighted,
and such miserable provisions as could be procured were furnished
to the harassed soldiery; and while strong pickets
were posted in the front and flanks, the remnant of the British,
with their brave allies, piled their arms and stretched themselves
on the field.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>While the British held their battle-ground, the Prussians
had been obliged to retire in the night from Ligny.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> This,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
however, was not ascertained until morning—as the aide-de-camp
despatched with the intelligence to Quatre Bras had unfortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
been killed on the road. Corps after corps arrived
during the night, placing the Duke of Wellington in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
position to have become assailant next morning had Blucher
succeeded in maintaining his position, and repulsed Napoleon’s
attack.</p>

<p>The night passed—the wounded were removed<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>—the
dead partially buried;—disabled guns were repaired, ammunition
served out, and all was ready for “a contest on the
morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
The intelligence of the Prussian retreat, of course, produced
a correspondent movement—and the Duke of Wellington, to
maintain his communications with Marshal Blucher, decided
on falling back upon a position in front of the village of
Waterloo, which had been already surveyed, and selected by
the allied leader as the spot on which he should make a
stand.</p>

<h2 id="chap_43">MOVEMENTS OF THE 17<span class="smcap smaller">TH</span> JUNE.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Napoleon arrives at Frasnes, and Wellington retires towards Waterloo.—Cavalry
affair at Genappe.—The allies take their position.—Dispositions
of the different corps.—The field of battle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Napoleon had reached Frasnes at nine o’clock on the morning
of the 17th, and determined on attacking the allied commander.
Still uncertain as to the route by which Blucher
was retiring, he detached Grouchy in pursuit with the third
and fourth corps, and the cavalry of Excelmans and Pajol,
with directions to overtake the Prussian marshal, if possible,
and in that case bring him to action.</p>

<p>While Buonaparte delayed his attack until his reserve and
the sixth corps came up, his abler antagonist was preparing to
retire. This operation in open day was difficult, as the Dyle
was in the rear of the allies, and the long and narrow bridge
at the village of Genappe the only means by which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps
d’armée</i> could effect its passage. Wellington disposed some
horse-artillery and dismounted dragoons upon the heights, and
leaving a strong rear-guard in front of Quatre Bras, he succeeded
in masking his retreat until, when discovered, it was
too late to offer any serious interruption to the regressive
movement of the allies. While the rear of the columns were
still defiling through the narrow streets of Genappe, Napoleon’s
advanced cavalry overtook and attacked the rear-guard, and a
sharp affair ensued. The 7th Hussars, assisted by some squadrons
of the 11th and 23rd Light Dragoons, charged the
French horsemen boldly—but they were repulsed; and a
second effort was bravely but ineffectually attempted. The
Life Guards were instantly ordered up, and led in person to
the charge by Lord Anglesea, who was in command of the
British rear-guard. Their attack was decisive—the enemy
were severely checked, and driven in great disorder back upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
their supports. No other attempt was made by the French
cavalry to embarrass the retreat of the allied columns—and
except by an occasional cannonade, too distant to produce any
serious effect, the remainder of the march on Waterloo was
undisturbed by the French advance.</p>

<p>The allies reached the position early in the evening, and
orders were issued for the divisions to halt and prepare their
bivouacs. The ground for each brigade had been already
marked out—the troops piled their arms,—the cavalry picketed
their horses—the guns were parked—fires were lighted along
the lines, and all prepared the best mode of sheltering themselves
from the inclemency of the weather, which scanty
means could afford them in an exposed position like that of
Waterloo.</p>

<p>All through the day rain had occasionally fallen—but as
night came on, the weather became more tempestuous. The
wind rose, and torrents of rain, with peals of thunder and
frequent lightning, rendered the dreary night before the battle
anything but a season of repose.</p>

<p>While the troops bivouacked on the field, the Duke of
Wellington with the general officers and their respective staffs
occupied the village of Waterloo. On the doors of the several
cottages the names of the principal officers were chalked—“and
frail and perishing as was the record, it was found there
long after many of those whom it designated had ceased to
exist!”</p>

<p>The ground on which the allied commander had decided to
accept battle was chosen with excellent judgment. In front
of the position, the surface declined for nearly a quarter of a
mile, and rose again for an equal distance, until it terminated
in a ridge of easy access, along which the French had posted a
number of their brigades—the intermediate space between the
armies being covered by a rich crop of rye nearly ready for the
sickle. In the rear, the forest of Soignies, intersected by the
great roads from Charleroi to Brussels, extended; and nearly
at the entrance to the wood, the little village of Waterloo was
situated. The right of the British was stretched over to
Merke Braine, and the left appuied upon a height above Ter
le Haye. The whole line was formed on a gentle acclivity
the flanks partially defended by a small ravine with broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
ground. The farm-house of La Haye Sainte, in front of the
left centre, was defended by a Hanoverian battalion—and the
chateau of Hougomont, in advance of the right centre, held by
a part of the Guards and a few companies of Nassau riflemen.
This was the strongest point of the whole position; and the
Duke had strengthened it considerably, by erecting barricades
and perforating the walls with loopholes, to permit the musketry
of its defenders to be effectively employed.</p>

<p>Wellington’s first line, comprising some of his best regiments,
was drawn up behind these posts—the second was still
farther in the rear, and, from occupying a hollow, was
sheltered from the fire of the French artillery. The third
was formed of the cavalry: and they were more retired
still, extending to Ter le Haye. The extreme right of the
British obliqued to Merke Braine, and covered the road to
Nivelles—while the left kept the communication with the
Prussians open by the Ohain road, which runs through the
passes of Saint Lambert. As it was not improbable that Napoleon
might endeavour to reach Brussels by marching circuitously
round the British right, a corps of observation, composed
of the greater portion of the fourth division, under Sir
Charles Colville, was detached to Halle; and consequently
those troops, during the long and bloody contest of the 18th,
were at a distance from the field, and remained <em>non-combatant</em>.</p>

<p>The allied dispositions were completed soon after daylight,
although it was nearly noon before the engagement seriously
commenced. The division of Guards, under General Cooke,
was posted on a rise immediately adjoining the chateau of
Hougomont, its right leaning on the road to Nivelles; the
division of Baron Alten, had its left flank on the road of
Charleroi, and was drawn up behind the house of La Haye
Sainte. The Brunswick troops were partly in line with the
Guards and partly held in reserve; and the Nassau troops
were generally attached to Alten’s division. Some of the
corps in line, and a battalion acting <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en tirailleur</i>, occupied
the wood of Hougomont. This <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> was commanded
by the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>The British divisions of Clinton and Colville, two Hanoverian
brigades, and a Dutch corps under the command of
Lord Hill, were placed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en potence</i>, in front of the right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
On the left, the division of Picton, a British brigade under
Sir John Lambert, a Hanoverian corps, and some troops of the
Netherlands, extended along the hedge and lane which traverses
the rising ground between the road to Charleroi and
Ter le Haye. This village, with the farm of Papilotte, contiguous
to the wood of Frichemont, was garrisoned by a post
of the Nassau contingent, commanded by the hereditary Prince
of Weimar. The cavalry were under the direction of the
Earl of Uxbridge—and the artillery were commanded by Sir
George Wood.</p>

<p>No part of the allied position was remarkable for natural
strength; but where the ground displayed any advantages,
they had been carefully made available for defence. The
whole surface of the field of Waterloo was perfectly open, and
the acclivities of easy ascent. Infantry movements could be
easily effected—artillery might advance and retire,—and cavalry
could charge. On every point the British position was
assailable; and the island soldier had no reliance but in “God
and his Grace”—for all else depended on his own stout heart
and vigorous arm.</p>

<h2 id="chap_44">BATTLE OF WATERLOO.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Morning of the 18th.—Armies in each other’s presence.—Opening, progress,
and close of the battle.—Losses sustained.—Subsequent operations.—Conclusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Morning broke—the rain still continued, but with less severity
than during the preceding night; the wind fell, but the
day lowered, and the dawn of the 18th<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> was gloomy and
foreboding. The British soldiers recovered from the chill cast
over them by the inclemency of the weather; and, from the
ridge of their position, calmly observed the enemy’s masses
coming up in long succession, and forming their numerous
columns on the heights in front of La Belle Alliance.</p>

<p>The bearing of the French was very opposite to the steady
and cool determination of the British soldiery. With the
former, all was exultation and arrogant display; while, with
characteristic vanity, they boasted of an imaginary success at
Quatre Bras, and claimed a decisive victory at Ligny!</p>

<p>Although, in point of fact, beaten by the British on the 16th,
Napoleon tortured the retrograde movement of the Duke on
Waterloo into a defeat; and the winning a field from Blucher,
attended with no advantage beyond the capture of a few disabled
guns, afforded a pretext to declare in his dispatches that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
the Prussian army was routed and disorganized, without a
prospect of being rallied.</p>

<p>The morning passed in mutual dispositions for battle—and
the French attack commenced soon after eleven o’clock.
The first corps, under Count D’Erlon, was in position opposite
La Haye Sainte, its right extending towards Frichemont,
and its left leaning on the road to Brussels. The second corps,
uniting its right with D’Erlon’s left, extended to Hougomont,
with the wood in its front.</p>

<p>The cavalry reserve (the cuirassiers) were immediately in
the rear of these corps; and the Imperial Guard, forming the
grand reserve, were posted on the heights of La Belle Alliance.
Count Lobau, with the sixth corps, and D’Aumont’s
cavalry, were placed in the rear of the extreme right, to check
the Prussians, should they advance from Wavre, and approach
by the defiles of Saint Lambert. Napoleon’s arrangements were
completed about half-past eleven, and immediately the order
to attack was given.</p>

<p>The place from which Buonaparte viewed the field, was a
gentle rising ground<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> beside the farm-house of La Belle Alliance.
There he remained for a considerable part of the day,
dismounted, pacing to and fro with his hands behind him,
receiving communications from his aides-de-camp, and issuing
orders to his officers. As the battle became more doubtful,
he approached nearer the scene of action, and betrayed increased
impatience to his staff by violent gesticulation, and
using immense quantities of snuff. At three o’clock he was
on horseback in front of La Belle Alliance; and in the evening,
just before he made his last attempt with the Guard, he
had reached a hollow close to La Haye Sainte. Wellington,
at the opening of the engagement, stood upon a ridge immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
behind La Haye, but as the conflict thickened, where
difficulties arose and danger threatened, there the duke was
found. He traversed the field exposed to a storm of balls, and
passed from point to point uninjured—and on more than one
occasion, when the French cavalry charged the British squares
the duke was there for shelter.</p>

<p>A slight skirmishing between the French tirailleurs and
English light troops had continued throughout the morning,
but the advance of a division of the second corps, under
Jerome Buonaparte, against the post of Hougomont, was the
signal for the British artillery to open, and was, in fact, the
commencement of the battle of Waterloo. The first gun fired
on the 18th was directed by Sir George Wood upon Jerome’s
advancing column; the last was a French howitzer, at eight
o’clock in the evening, turned by a British officer against the
routed remains of that splendid army with which Napoleon
had begun the battle.</p>

<p>Hougomont<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> was the key of the duke’s position, a post
naturally of considerable strength, and care had been taken to
increase it. It was garrisoned by the light companies of the
Coldstream and 1st and 3rd Guards;<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> while a detachment
from General Byng’s brigade was formed on an eminence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
behind, to support the troops defending the house and the
wood<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> on its left. Three hundred Nassau riflemen were stationed
in the wood and garden; but the first attack of the
enemy dispersed them.</p>

<p>To carry Hougomont, the efforts of the second corps were
principally directed throughout the day. This fine corps,
thirty thousand strong, comprised three divisions; and each of
these, in quick succession, attacked the well-defended farm-house.
The advance of the assailants was covered by a tremendous
cross-fire of nearly one hundred pieces, while the
British guns in battery on the heights above, returned the
cannonade, and made fearful havoc in the dense columns of
the enemy as they advanced or retired from the attack.
Although the French frequently occupied the wood, it afforded
them indifferent shelter from the musketry of the troops defending
the house and garden; for the trees were but slight, and
planted far asunder. Foy’s division passed entirely through
and gained the heights in the rear; but it was driven back
with immense loss by part of the Coldstream and 3rd
Guards.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></p>

<p>At last, despairing of success, the French artillery opened
with shells upon the house; the old tower of Hougomont was
quickly in a blaze; the fire reached the chapel, and many of
the wounded, both assailants and defenders, perished miserably
there. But still, though the flames raged above, shells
burst around, and shot ploughed through the shattered walls
and windows, the Guards nobly held the place, and Hougomont
remained untaken.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> It was computed that Napoleon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
repeated and desperate attacks upon this post cost him eight
thousand men. The British lost fourteen hundred.</p>

<p>The advance of Jerome on the right was followed by a
general onset upon the British line—three hundred pieces of
artillery opening their cannonade, and the French columns in
different points advancing to the attack. Charges of cavalry
and infantry, sometimes separately and sometimes with united
force, were made in vain. The British regiments were disposed,
individually, in squares, with triple files, each placed
sufficiently apart to allow it to deploy when requisite. The
squares were mostly parallel, but a few were judiciously thrown
back; and this disposition, when the French cavalry had passed
the advanced regiments, exposed them to a flanking fire from
the squares behind. The English cavalry were in the rear of
the infantry, and the artillery in battery over the line. The
fight of Waterloo may be easily comprehended by simply
stating, that for ten hours it was a continued succession of
attacks of the French columns on the squares; the British
artillery playing upon them as they advanced, and the cavalry
charging when they receded.</p>

<p>“But no situation could be more trying to the unyielding
courage of the British army than this disposition in squares at
Waterloo. There is an excited feeling in an attacking body
that stimulates the coldest and blunts the thoughts of danger.
The tumultuous enthusiasm of the assault spreads from man to
man, and duller spirits catch a gallant frenzy from the brave
around them. But the enduring and devoted courage which
pervaded the British squares when, hour after hour, mowed
down by a murderous artillery, and wearied by furious and
frequent onsets of lancers and cuirassiers; when the constant
order, “Close up!—close up!” marked the quick succession
of slaughter that thinned their diminished ranks; and when
the day wore later, when the remnants of two, and even three
regiments were necessary to complete the square, which one
of them had formed in the morning—to support this with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
firmness, and ‘feed death,’ inactive and unmoved, exhibited
that calm and desperate bravery which elicited the admiration
of Napoleon himself.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<p>At times the temper of the troops had nearly failed; and,
particularly among the Irish regiments, the reiterated question
of—“When shall we get at them?” showed how ardent the
wish was to avoid inactive slaughter, and, plunging into the
columns of the assailants, to avenge the death of their companions.
But the “Be cool, my boys!” from their officers was
sufficient to restrain this impatience—and, cumbering the
ground with their dead, they waited with desperate intrepidity
for the hour to arrive when victory and vengeance should be
their own!</p>

<p>While the second corps was engaged at Hougomont, the
first was directed by Napoleon to penetrate the left centre.
Had this attempt succeeded, the British must have been defeated,
as it would have been severed and surrounded. Picton’s
division was now severely engaged. Its position
stretched from La Haye Sainte to Ter la Haye; in front there
was an irregular hedge; but being broken and pervious to
cavalry, it afforded but partial protection. The Belgian
infantry, who were extended in front of the fifth division,
gave way as the leading columns of D’Erlon’s corps approached—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
French came boldly to the fence—and Picton, with
Kempt’s brigade, as gallantly advanced to meet them.</p>

<p>A tremendous combat ensued. The French and British
closed; for the cuirassiers had been already received in squares
and repulsed with immense loss. Instantly Picton deployed
the division into line; and pressing forward to the hedge,
received and returned the volley of D’Erlon’s infantry, and
then crossing the fence, drove back the enemy at the point of
the bayonet. The French retreated in close column, while the
fifth mowed them down with musketry, and slaughtered them
in heaps with their bayonets. Lord Anglesea seized on the
moment, and charging with the Royals, Greys, and Enniskilleners,
burst through every thing that opposed him. Vainly
the mailed cuirassier and formidable lancer attempted to withstand
this splendid body of heavy cavalry: they were overwhelmed;
and the French infantry, already broken and disorganized
by the gallant fifth, fell in hundreds beneath the swords
of the English dragoons. The eagles of the 45th and 105th
regiments, and upwards of two thousand prisoners, were the
trophies of this brilliant charge.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p>But, alas! like most military triumphs, this had its misfortune
to alloy it. “Picton fell! But where could the famed
commander of the old ‘Fighting Third’ meet with death so gloriously?
He was at the head of the division as it pressed forward
with the bayonet; he saw the best troops of Napoleon
repulsed; the ball struck him, and he fell from his horse; he
heard the Highland lament answered by the deep execration
of Erin; and while the Scotch slogan was returned by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
Irish hurrah, his fading sight saw his excited division rush on
with irresistible fury. The French column was annihilated—and
two thousand dead enemies told how desperately he had
been avenged. This was, probably, the bloodiest struggle
of the day. When the attack commenced—and it lasted not
an hour—the fifth division exceeded five thousand men;
and when it ended, it scarcely reckoned eighteen hundred
bayonets!”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></p>

<p>While Picton’s division and the heavy cavalry had repulsed
D’Erlon’s effort against the left, the battle was raging at La
Haye Sainte, a post in front of the left centre. This was a
rude farm-house and barn, defended by five hundred German
riflemen; and here the attack was fierce and constant, and
the defence gallant and protracted. While a number of guns
played on it with shot and shells, it was assailed by a strong
column of infantry. Thrice they were repulsed; but the barn
caught fire, and the number of the garrison decreasing, it was
found impossible, from its exposed situation, to supply the loss,
and throw in reinforcements. Still worse, the ammunition of
the rifle corps failed—and reduced to a few cartridges, their
fire had almost ceased.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this casualty, the French, at the fourth attempt,
turned the position. Though the doors were burst in,
still the gallant Germans held the house with their bayonets;
but, having ascended the walls and roof, the French fired on
them from above, and, now reduced to a handful, the post was
carried. No quarter was given—and the remnant of the
brave riflemen were bayoneted on the spot.</p>

<p>This was, however, the only point where, during this long
and sanguinary conflict, Buonaparte succeeded. He became
master of a dilapidated dwelling, its roof destroyed by shells,
and its walls perforated by a thousand shot-holes; and when
obtained, an incessant torrent of grape and shrapnels from the
British artillery on the heights above, rendered its acquisition
useless for future operations, and made his persistance in maintaining
it, a wanton and unnecessary sacrifice of human life.</p>

<p>There was a terrible sameness in the battle of the 18th of
June, which distinguished it in the history of modern slaughter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
Although designated by Napoleon “a day of false manœuvres,”
in reality, there was less display of military tactics
at Waterloo, than in any general action we have on record.
Buonaparte’s favourite plan, to turn a wing, or separate a
corps, was the constant effort of the French leader. Both
were tried—at Hougomont to turn the right, and at La Haye
Sainte to break through the left centre.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> Hence, the French
operations were confined to fierce and incessant onsets with
masses of cavalry and infantry, generally supported by a numerous
and destructive artillery. Knowing, that to repel
these desperate and sustained attacks, a tremendous sacrifice
of human life must occur, Napoleon, in defiance of their acknowledged
bravery, calculated on wearying the British into
defeat. But when he saw his columns driven back in confusion—when
his cavalry receded from the squares they could
not penetrate—when battalions were reduced to companies by
the fire of his cannon, and still that “feeble few” shewed a
perfect front,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> and held the ground they had originally taken—no
wonder his admiration was expressed to Soult—“How
beautifully these English fight! but they must give way!”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></p>

<p>And well did British bravery merit that proud encomium,
which their enduring courage elicited from Napoleon. For
hours, with uniform and unflinching gallantry, they repulsed
the attacks of troops who had already proved their superiority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
over the soldiers of every other nation in Europe. When the
artillery united its fire, and poured exterminating volleys on
some devoted regiment, the square, prostrate on the earth, allowed
the storm to pass over them. When the battery ceased,
to permit their cavalry to charge and complete the work of
destruction, the square was again upon their feet—no face
unformed—no chasm to allow the horsemen entrance—but a
serried line of impassable bayonets was before them, while the
rear ranks threw in a reserved fire with murderous precision.
The cuirass was too near the musket then to avert death from
the wearer—men and horses went down in heaps—each attempt
ended in defeat—and the cavalry at last retired, leaving
their best and boldest before a square, which, to them, had
proved impenetrable.</p>

<p>When the close column of infantry came on, the square
had deployed into line. The French were received with a
destructive volley, and next moment the wild cheer which
accompanies the bayonet charge, announced that England
advanced with the weapon she had always found irresistible.
The French never crossed bayonets fairly with the British;
for when an attempt was made to stand, a terrible slaughter
attested England’s superiority.</p>

<p>But the situation of Wellington momentarily became more
critical. Masses of the enemy had fallen, but thousands came
on anew. With desperate attachment, the French army
passed forward at Napoleon’s command—and although each
advance terminated in defeat and slaughter, fresh battalions
crossed the valley, and mounting the ridge with cries of “Vive
l’Empereur!” exhibited a devotion which never had been
surpassed. Wellington’s reserves had been gradually brought
into action—and the left, though but partially engaged, could
not be weakened to send assistance to the right and centre.
Many battalions were miserably reduced; and the fifth division,
already cut up at Quatre Bras on the evening of the
16th, presented but a skeleton of what these beautiful brigades
had been when they left Brussels two days before. The loss
of individual regiments was prodigious. The 27th had four
hundred men mowed down in square without drawing a trigger;
it lost all its superior officers; and a solitary subaltern
who remained, commanded it for half the day. Another, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
92nd regiment, when not two hundred were left, rushed at a
French column and routed it with the bayonet; and a third,
the 33rd, when nearly annihilated, sent to require support—none
could be given; and the commanding officer was told
that he must “stand or fall where he was!”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p>Any other save Wellington would have despaired; but he
calculated, and justly, that he had an army which would
perish where it stood. But when he saw the devastation
caused by the incessant attacks of an enemy who appeared
determined to succeed, is it surprising that his watch was frequently
consulted, and that he prayed for night or Blucher?
When evening came on, no doubt Buonaparte began to question
the accuracy of his “military arithmetic,”—a phrase
happily applied to this meting out death by the hour. Half
the day had been consumed in a sanguinary and indecisive
conflict; all his disposable troops but the Guard had been
employed, and still his efforts were foiled; and the British,
with diminished numbers, shewed the same bold front they
had presented at the commencement of the battle. He determined,
therefore, on another desperate attempt upon the whole
British line; and while issuing orders to effect it, a distant
cannonade announced that a fresh force was approaching to
share the action. Napoleon, concluding that Grouchy was
coming up, conveyed the glad tidings to his disheartened columns.
But an aide-de-camp quickly removed the mistake—and
the Emperor received the unwelcome intelligence that
the strange force now distinctly observed debouching from the
woods of Saint Lambert, was the advanced guard of a Prussian
corps. Buonaparte appeared, or affected to appear, incredulous;
but the fatal truth was ascertained too soon.</p>

<p>While the delusive hope of immediate relief was industriously
circulated among his troops, Napoleon despatched
Count Lobau, with the sixth corps, to employ the Prussians,
while in person, he should direct a general attack upon the
British Line.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prussian advance had debouched from the
wood of Frichermont, and the operations of the old marshal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
in the rear of Napoleon’s right flank became alarming. If
Blucher established himself there in force, unless success
against the British in his front was rapid and decisive, or that
Grouchy came promptly to his relief, Buonaparte knew well
that his situation must be hopeless. Accordingly, he directed
the first and second corps and all his cavalry reserves against
the duke,—the French mounted the heights once more—and
the British were attacked from right to left.</p>

<p>A dreadful and protracted encounter followed; for an hour
the contest was sustained, and, like the preceding ones, it was
a sanguinary succession of determined attack and obstinate
resistance. The impetuosity of the French onset at first
obtained a temporary success. The English light cavalry
were driven back,—and for a time a number of the guns were
in the enemy’s possession,—but the British rallied again—the
French forced across the ridge, retired to their original
ground, without effecting any permanent impression.</p>

<p>It was now five o’clock; the Prussian reserve cavalry
under Prince William was warmly engaged with Count Lobau—Bulow’s
corps, with the second, under Pirch, were approaching
rapidly through the passes of Saint Lambert; and the
first Prussian corps, advancing by Ohain, had already begun
to operate on Napoleon’s right.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> Bulow pushed forward
towards Aywire, and, opening his fire on the French, succeeded
in driving them from the opposite heights.</p>

<p>The Prussian left, acting separately, advanced upon the
village of Planchenoit, and attacked Napoleon’s rear. The
French maintaining their position with great gallantry, and
the Prussians, being equally obstinate in their attempts to
force the village, produced a bloody and prolonged combat.
Napoleon’s right had begun to recede before the first Prussian
corps, and his officers, generally, anticipated a disastrous issue,
that nothing but immediate success against the British, or
instant relief from Grouchy, could remedy. The Imperial
Guard, his last and best resource, were consequently ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
up. Formed in close column, Buonaparte in person advanced
to lead them on; but dissuaded by his staff, he paused near
the bottom of the hill, and to Ney, that “spoiled child of
victory,” the conduct of this redoubted body was intrusted.
In the interim, as the French right fell back, the British
moved gradually forward; and converging from the extreme
points of Merke Braine and Braine la Leud, compressed their
extent of line, and nearly assumed the form of a crescent.
The Guards were considerably advanced, and having deployed
behind the crest of the hill, lay down to avoid the cannonade
with which Napoleon covered the onset of his best troops.
Ney, with his proverbial gallantry, led on the Middle Guard;
and Wellington, putting himself at the head of some wavering
regiments, in person brought them forward, and restored
their confidence.</p>

<p>As the Imperial Guard approached the crest where the
household troops were couching, the British artillery, which
had gradually converged upon the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chaussée</i>, opened with
canister-shot. The distance was so short,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> and the range so
accurate, that each discharge fell with deadly precision into
the column as it breasted the hill. Ney, with his customary
heroism, directed the attack; and when his horse was killed—on
foot, and sword in hand, he headed the veterans whom he
had so often led to victory. Although the leading files of the
Guard were swept off by the exterminating fire of the
English batteries, still their undaunted intrepidity carried
them forward, and they gallantly crossed the ridge.</p>

<p>Then came the hour of British triumph. The magic word
was spoken—“Up, Guards, and at them!” In a moment
the household brigade were on their feet: then waiting till
the French closed, they delivered a murderous volley,
cheered, and rushed forward with the bayonet, Wellington in
person directing the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
With the 42nd and 95th, the British leader threw himself
on Ney’s flank, and rout and destruction succeeded. In vain
their gallant chief attempted to rally the recoiling Guard;
but driven down the hill, the Middle were intermingled with
the Old Guard, who had formed at the bottom in reserve.</p>

<p>In this unfortunate <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>, the British cavalry seized on
the moment of confusion, and plunging into the mass, cut
down and disorganized the regiments which had hitherto been
unbroken. The British artillery ceased firing—and those who
had escaped the iron shower of the guns, fell beneath sabre
and bayonet.</p>

<p>The unremediable disorder consequent on this decisive repulse,
and the confusion in the French rear, where Bulow had
fiercely attacked them, did not escape the eagle glance of
Wellington. “The hour is come!” he is said to have exclaimed,
as, closing his telescope, he commanded the whole
line to advance. The order was exultingly obeyed; and,
forming four deep, on came the British. Wounds, and
fatigue, and hunger, were all forgotten, as with their customary
steadiness they crossed the ridge; but when they saw
the French, and began to move down the hill, a cheer that
seemed to rend the heavens pealed from their proud array, as
with levelled bayonets they pressed on to meet the enemy.</p>

<p>But, panic-struck and disorganized, the French resistance
was short and feeble. The Prussian cannon thundered in
their rear—the British bayonet was flashing in their front—and
unable to stand the terror of the charge, they broke and
fled. A dreadful and indiscriminate carnage ensued. The
great road was choked with equipages, and cumbered with
the dead and dying; while the fields, as far as the eye could
reach, were covered with a host of helpless fugitives.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> Courage
and discipline were forgotten; and Napoleon’s army of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
yesterday was now a splendid wreck—a terror-stricken multitude!
His own words best describe it—“It was a total
rout!”</p>

<p>Never had France sent a finer army to the field—and never
had any been so signally defeated. Complete as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i>
at Vittoria had appeared, it fell infinitely short of that sustained
at Waterloo. Tired of slaughtering unresisting foes,
the British, early in the night, abandoned the pursuit of the
broken battalions and halted. But the Prussians, untamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
by previous exertion, continued to follow the fugitives with
increased activity, and nothing could surpass the unrelenting
animosity of their pursuit. Plunder was sacrificed to revenge—and
the memory of former defeat and past oppression produced
a dreadful retaliation, and deadened every impulse of
humanity. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">væ victis</i> was pronounced—and thousands,
besides those who perished in the field, fell that night by
Prussian lance and sabre.</p>

<p>What Napoleon’s feelings were when he witnessed the overthrow
of his guard—the failure of his last hope—the death-blow
to his political existence, cannot be described, but may
be easily imagined. Turning to an aide-de-camp, with a face
livid with rage and despair, he muttered in a tremulous voice—“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">A
présent c’est fini!—sauvons nous</i>;” and turning his
horse, he rode hastily off towards Charleroi, attended by his
guide and staff.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In whatever point of view Waterloo is considered, whether
as a battle, a victory, or an event, in all these, every occurrence
of the last century yields, and more particularly in the
magnitude of results. No doubt the successes of Wellington
in Spain were, in a great degree, primary causes of Napoleon’s
downfal; but still the victory of Waterloo consummated
efforts made for years before in vain to achieve the freedom of
the Continent—and wrought the final ruin of him, through
whose unhallowed ambition a world had been so long convulsed.</p>

<p>As a battle, the merits of the field of Waterloo have been
freely examined, and very indifferently adjudicated.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> Those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
who were best competent to decide, have pronounced this
battle as that upon which Wellington might securely rest his
fame—while others, admitting the extent of the victory,
ascribe the result rather to fortunate accident than military
skill.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>Never was a falser statement hazarded. The success
attendant on the day of Waterloo can be referred only to the
admirable system of resistance in the general, and an enduring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
valour, rarely equalled and never surpassed, in the soldiers
whom he commanded. Chance, at Waterloo, had no effect
upon results;—Wellington’s surest game was to act only on
the defensive—his arrangements with Blucher, for mutual
support, being thoroughly matured, he knew that before night
the Prussians must be upon the field. Bad weather and bad
roads, with the conflagration of a town in the line of march,
which, to save the Prussian tumbrils from explosion, required a
circuitous movement—all these, while they protracted the
struggle for several hours beyond what might have been reasonably
computed, only go to prove that Wellington, in
accepting battle, under a well-founded belief that he should be
supported in <em>four hours</em>—when single-handed he maintained
the combat and resolutely held his ground during a space of
<em>eight</em>, had left nothing dependent upon accident, but, providing
for the worst contingencies, had formed his calculations with
admirable skill.</p>

<p>The apologists for Napoleon lay much stress on Ney’s dilatory
march on Quatre Bras, and Grouchy’s unprofitable movements
on the Dyle. The failure of Ney upon the 16th will
be best accounted for by that marshal’s simple statement.
His reserve was withdrawn by Napoleon—and when the
Prince of Moskwa required and ordered it forward, to make
a grand effort on the wearied English, the corps “was idly
parading” between Quatre Bras and Ligny; and during the
arduous struggle at both places, that splendid division had
never faced an enemy or discharged a musket. Ney’s failure
in his attack was therefore attributable to Napoleon altogether—for
had his reserve been at hand, who can suppose that the
exhausted battalions of the allies, after a march of two-and-twenty
miles, and a long and bloody combat, must not have
yielded to fresh troops in overpowering masses, and fallen back
from a position tenable no longer? To Grouchy’s imputed
errors, also, the loss of Waterloo has been mainly ascribed
both by Napoleon and his admirers. But that marshal’s
conduct was not obnoxious to the censure so unsparingly
bestowed upon it—for, had he disobeyed orders, and acceded
to the proposition of his second in command, would a movement
by his left have effected any thing beyond the delay of
Napoleon’s overthrow for a night? By following Girard’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
advice, and marching direct on Waterloo, the day would have
ended, probably, in a drawn battle—or even Wellington might
have been obliged to retire into the wood of Soignies. But in
a few hours Blucher would have been up—in the morning the
Anglo-Prussian army would have become assailant—and with
numbers far superior, who will pretend to say that Napoleon’s
defeat upon the 19th, would not have been as certain and as
signal as his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déroute</i> at Waterloo, upon the fatal evening that
closed upon a fallen empire and a last field?</p>

<p>The allied loss<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> was enormous, but it fell infinitely short of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
that sustained by Napoleon’s army. Of the latter nothing
like an accurate return was ever made—but from the most
correct estimates by French and British officers, upwards of
five-and-twenty thousand men were rendered <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>;
while multitudes were sabred in the flight, or perished on the
roads from sheer fatigue, and in deserted villages for want of
sustenance and surgical relief.</p>

<p>On the 19th the Duke of Wellington was again in motion,
and having crossed the frontier, he marched upon the French
capital by Binch, Malplaquet, and Château Cambresis. Colville’s
division, composed of part of the sixth British and sixth
Hanoverians, took the advance of the army, and carried Cambray
by assault on the evening of the 24th. Peronne la
Pucelle was on the following day stormed by the Guards—and
on the 30th, the Duke of Wellington’s light cavalry were
close to the walls of Paris.</p>

<p>Grouchy’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i>, amounting to forty thousand men,
when detached on the 17th by Napoleon to prevent a junction
of the Prussians with the British, reached Gembloux immediately
after Blucher’s rear-guard had quitted that place on
its route to Wavre. At Baraque, early next morning, the
French cavalry overtook the Prussians, attacked, and
drove them back. At one o’clock a heavy cannonade was
distinctly heard—and Girard urged Grouchy to leave a corps
of observation in front of the Prussians, and march direct on
Waterloo, while Vandamme, on the contrary, pressed the
marshal to move at once on Brussels. Grouchy, however, was
determined to obey the strict letter of his instructions, and
made every effort to bring the Prussians to action. At six in
the evening, one of many officers, despatched by Napoleon to
order Grouchy to march to his assistance, succeeded in finding
the marshal and delivered the order of the emperor. It was
now six o’clock—and the marshal crossed the Dyle and
moved rapidly towards Waterloo—but all there was lost; and
at daybreak, on learning the fatal news, Grouchy abandoned
his line of march, repassed the Dyle in four divisions, and
joined the cavalry of Excelmans at Namur on the following
morning. The marshal, for a time, held that town; while
his rear-guard, commanded by Vandamme,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> checked the Prussians—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
then retiring by Dinant, he brought his corps
safely to Paris after a march of eight days, and by a retreat that
his enemies admitted to be conducted with admirable skill.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Blucher, having masked the fortresses of Maubuge,
Landrecy, and Phillipville, took possession of St.
Quentin, while Zeithen advanced to Guise. On the 29th, he
halted in front of the French position between St. Denis and
Vincennes—having succeeded in gaining a day’s march on his
indefatigable ally the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>On that evening Napoleon quitted the capital never to enter
it again. Hostilities ceased immediately—the Bourbons were
recalled, and placed upon the throne—and Europe, after
years of anarchy and bloodshed, at last obtained repose—while
he, “alike its wonder and its scourge,” was removed to
a scene far distant from that which had witnessed his triumphs
and his reverses—and within the narrow limits of a paltry
island, that haughty spirit, for whom half Europe was too
small, dragged out a gloomy existence, until death loosened
the chain, and the grave closed upon the Captive of Saint
Helena.</p>

<span class="subhead">Condition of Europe after the battle of Waterloo.—Necessity for peace.</span></h2>

<p>A period of undisturbed repose succeeded that fearful
interval in European history, extending from the murder of
a weak and worthless monarch, to the deposition of the
master spirit of the age, who had founded a blood-cemented
throne on the ruins of a corrupt and licentious dynasty.
From the revolutionary outbreak to the peace of Paris, the
annals of these stormy times are but a continuous record of
violence and slaughter—for the brief cessation of hostilities
in 1801, was employed, on both sides, in active preparations
to recommence a deadlier struggle—and France and
England, like angry and exhausted duellists, rested only for
the moment, until, with recruited strength, they might renew
the game of death more furiously. As “time and the hour
run through the longest day,” so national resources at last
must find a limit—for if war be a sanguinary, it is also a most
expensive pursuit. Save those of Britain and France, the
European exchequers were exhausted—one country finding
her marvellous resources in the honest supplies which flowed
in from possessions on which a sun never sets<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a>—the other, by
adopting a nefarious policy of making war support war—or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
in plain language, obliging the aggressed to find all for the
aggressor that he might require. War cripples trade—and
“the nation of shopkeepers,” as Napoleon contemptuously
designated England, felt the monetary pressure heavily—and
John Bull, when called upon again and again, growled as he
unclosed his purse-strings—but he always came forward
when money was required. The enormity of these demands,
appeared only to elicit the boundless extent of the means
upon which England could fall back—for in one year<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> the
naval and military expenditure of the country exceeded the
almost incredible total of forty-two millions sterling, without
including immense subsidiatory outlays to friendly powers
and foreign mercenaries.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

<p>On the continent, the conscriptive system then in operation
was virtually the same, although under different provisions
and modifications. The greater European powers could
always bring a force to the field numerically imposing—but
that all-important requisite to carry out war—namely, the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">métallique</i>, was wanting. Men without money are mere
automatons—they have no motive capability,—and before a
continental brigade could make an opening march, England
had to furnish them with what is figuratively, but correctly
called—“the sinews.”</p>

<p>Did France escape the iron pressure of the times that all
besides upon the continent felt so sensibly? Her trade had
been for years annihilated—and, unscrupulous as the means
resorted to were by which her empty coffers might be filled,
the end now could not be realized. Plunder, territorial or
fiscal—the annexation of a state, or the imposition of a forced
loan—all these from a too frequent repetition, had failed
at last. Her neighbours, who formerly had been her El
Dorado, were neither in temper nor situation to be longer made
available to meet her necessities. Schoolmen say “ex nihilo
nihil fit,”—Napoleon found the truth of that admitted adage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>—and
“beautiful France” was required to look to her fair
self for her resources.</p>

<p>But however, and by what means, money might have been
procured, to meet exigencies which towards the end of the war
daily became more stringent, a more fearful difficulty occurred,
because it was not remediable—not only the wealth, but the
<em>physique</em> of the country was exhausted—and the eternal
drains made upon the French population shewed the natural
consequences which all must have foreseen. Thousands after
thousands of her best and bravest had crossed the frontier
never to return—and anticipated conscriptions produced in a
levy of raw youth but indifferent food for powder. When
addressing the council of state on his return from his
disastrous campaign in Germany, this fatal truth escaped,—and
on this occasion Napoleon, descending from his former
affectation of Roman dignity, betrayed the exhaustion of the
country. His language was common-place and passionate,
and his disjointed harangue hurried from his dangers to his
designs. “Wellington,” said he, “is in the south—the
Russians threaten the northern frontier—Austria the south-eastern,—yet,
shame to speak it, the nation has not risen in
mass to repel them! Every ally has abandoned me: the
Bavarians have betrayed me!—Peace? no peace till Munich
is in flames! I demand of you 300,000 men; I will form a
camp at Bordeaux of 100,000, another at Lyons, a third at
Metz: with the remnant of my former levies, I shall have
1,000,000 of men in arms. But it is men whom I demand,—full-grown
men; not these miserable striplings who choke my
hospitals with sick, and my highways with carcases. Give
up Holland? rather let it sink into the sea! Peace, it
seems, is talked of when all around ought to re-echo with the
cry of war!”</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, when after his most singular and
successful evasion from Elba, that all save those nameless
men, on whom war bestows an evanescent consequence,
sincerely desired the state of tranquillity which followed so
quick upon the hundred days’ <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">émeute</i>. Europe, as Napoleon
used to say, when “peace was on his lips and deadly intents
raging in his bosom”—required repose. All felt the necessity
and admitted it—and for more than a quarter of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
century, the external relations of the continental powers have
since continued amicable.</p>

<p>There were times, however, when this peaceful state of
things was threatened with interruption—but happily the temperate
policy of the prudent countervailed the rashness of
those desperate men, who, in a settled order of things, have
no position in society. Occasionally, the thunder grumbled—but
the gathering clouds dispersed again. A revolution was
effected—and not a bloodless one—and yet the rest of Europe
looked calmly on. As at Algiers, Navarino, and elsewhere, the
great powers found it necessary sometimes to put forth their
strength—but generally, these operations were in connection.
France has carried on a petty and inglorious contest in
Polynesia, and a more unprofitable one in Africa;—and Russia,
with neither credit nor success, made vain attempts upon the
Circassian mountaineers—England the while looked calmly on;
her attitude was dignified—the lion couched—but woe
betide any who provoked his spring! The absurd and
unjust demands of her transatlantic neighbours—“a little
more than kin, and less than kind”—were temperately but
emphatically negatived. The idle threats of a feeble power—feeble
from conflicting interests, and inert from its overgrowth,
were heard with full contempt—Yankee orators thundered
her <em>delenda</em>—but England smiled, and merely asked
them to pay their debts—for she well knew that, like stubble
fired, a demagogue’s fury blazes, scintillates, and becomes
smoke.</p>

<p>And did Britain thus remain unmoved in the abundant
conviction of her own security?—No—she despised impotent
threatenings, as strongly as she repudiated impudent demands.
She knew that to America, war would produce annihilation.
The thunderbolt was lying at her foot—and the hand was
ready to launch it. The first angry shot discharged would
have covered the ocean with her fleets—and in a few brief
months, nothing under stars and stripes would have been seen
upon the Atlantic—a ruined trade and servile war must have
resulted—and the States would have been as a consequence
partitioned.</p>

<p>A radical’s course of action, in or out of Parliament, is the
same. His business is not to see what is right, but if possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
to discover what is wrong—and if he can’t find it, he must
fancy it. No one can deny that the Admiralty—Whig and
Tory, without distinction, are blundering eternally—but as the
resources of England seem illimitable, failures are rendered
nugatory—and errors, when remediable, heedless of the
expense uselessly occasioned, are corrected. Every candid
and unprejudiced officer will admit that Britain had never a
navy before, to be compared with that which she now possesses—and
on careful examination, it will be found that her military
establishment is still more perfect.</p>

<p>Never did a great power spring from military insignificance
to acknowledged superiority, so rapidly as Great Britain.
In 1805, she was a by-word among nations—in 1815, her
martial character was first in European estimation, although
ten brief years before it had held the lowest place.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> Like
ore unsought for, talent, as gold when in the mine, often continues
for centuries in abeyance, until circumstances evoke it.
As in individuals, so also national capabilities may be accidentally
developed—and what England was ignorant of possessing,
the Peninsula was first fated to disclose.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To a far more limited extent than that which had been felt
in France—England found that the deteriorating effects of
twenty years’ war were making themselves apparent upon her
own population. The necessity of dragging beardless boys
from home to fill her hospitals did not exist—but an immense
bounty, and a lowered standard in recruiting, proved that the
Moloch of the battle-field made demands which with difficulty
could be answered.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> In her militia she had an admirable
reserve to fall back upon—their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> volunteered freely for
the line—and hence, the strength of regiments in the field was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
maintained by constant drafts of disciplined soldiers. As the
war progressed, the efficiency of the Peninsular divisions as
steadily advanced—until Wellington might say, as he did,
with truth, that the army with which he crossed the Pyrenees
was “the most perfect machine that ever had been constructed,
and one with which he could do any thing and
go anywhere.”—Glorious be the memory of these matchless
soldiers!</p>

<p>Peace came—and the military establishment of Britain was
of necessity reduced. With a few exceptions, the regiments
of the line lost their additional battalions—every man not
thoroughly serviceable was discharged—and the militias were
disbanded. But England had at last found where her hidden
strength had so long lain dormant. Formerly her sole
dependence rested on her wooden walls—her dominion over
ocean was undisputed—there was not a sea on which her
proud ensign did not float—nor a corner of the earth unvisited
by her trading vessels. The Peninsula, however, had given
her another arm—she had proved its power, and determined
that the integrity of its strength should be preserved—and,
while in number her army was reduced, in efficiency it was
augmented. No longer drained of the flower of her youth,
and obliged to fill up the casualties incident to siege and
battle-field with levies from her population, physically inferior,
she now only recruited picked men. To the experience of
the past, the improvements of modern science were united—and
under the chief-commandership of the honoured and
lamented Hill, the organization of the British army became
perfect. Sacred be that great and good man’s memory!
Living—he was easy of access, bland in his manner, and
honest in his purpose—and dead, he bequeathed to the soldier
the example of a well-earned fame—and to his country, an
army—as far as numbers go—unmatched, unmatchable—in
Europe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Shah invades Affghanistan.—Sir John Keane advances on Candahar.—Reduction
of Ghuznee.—Surrender of Dost Mahomed.—Retreat of
Monson.—Bailey’s surrender.</p></blockquote>

<p>Twenty years elapsed—and so far as England was concerned,
Europe continued tranquil. If the British sword did
not rust, it rested quietly in the sheath—and the East ere long
was destined to prove, that during that period of inactivity,
its temper had remained unaltered.</p>

<p>Throughout this work European politics have been carefully
eschewed—and the complications, falsity, and foul character
of Eastern diplomacy, would be irrelevant, and disgust but not
interest. In 1836, the aggressive acts of Persia, influenced
by Russian gold, were sufficiently alarming, but all doubt was
removed, when the Shah invaded Affghanistan, and laid
siege to Herat. Although that city held strongly out, and
finally repulsed the Persians, the country generally was
anxious for their alliance,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> and to check an influence that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
might prove truly dangerous hereafter, the Indian government
decided on an armed intervention, and the restoration of Shah
Shoojah was made the apology for a hostile demonstration.</p>

<p>The entrance of an invading army into Affghanistan was
heralded by the Simla declaration,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> and a strong force, termed
“the army of the Indus,” in due time penetrated this mountain
country by the route of the Bolan Pass.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p>The occupation of Affghanistan was disastrous from the
first. The troops were severely harassed and half-starved—and
the blunders of the political agents, want of cordiality in
the commanders, dissension between the contingents of Bengal
and Bombay, all gave little promise of ultimate success.
Early in April, Sir John Keane joined and took the chief
command, and on the 7th he advanced on Candahar. The
march was extremely oppressive. Intense heat, want of water,
desultory attacks, all made the movement a distressing one,
but Candahar was at last reached, and Shah Shoojah restored
to the Musnad.</p>

<p>Sir John’s next operation was the reduction of Ghuznee,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
and it would appear rather unaccountable that with this
strong fortress before him, he should have left his siege-train
at Candahar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
Sir John, however, seemed to hold Peninsular practice in
fortunate recollection, for he repeated at Ghuznee,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> what
Brochard, a French engineer, had tried so successfully at
Amarante,<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> blew down a barricade, and carried the place by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
storm. Khelat<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> was subsequently taken by assault, and the
army of the Indus soon after broken up,—the Bombay
contingent retiring to cantonments, and the Bengal retaining
military occupation of Cabool.</p>

<p>Dost Mahomed, who had escaped, immediately appeared in
arms, and the tribes between the Oxus and Hindoo Koosh
broke out into open insurrection. Dennie defeated the Affghan
chief in front of Bameean, and Sale took Tootundurrah, Jugla,
and Rahderrah. With exhausted resources, the Dost found
that to continue a contest would be hopeless,—and on the 3rd
of November, he surrendered to the envoy, the unfortunate
Sir William MacNaughten.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p>The next epoch in Indian history is painfully unfortunate,
and the military occupation of Affghanistan forms a fearful
pendant to Monson’s retreat<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> and Bailey’s surrender. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
resistance of Bailey was most glorious,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> but the retreats from
Hindustan and Cabool were consequences of indecision and
want of daring. By the latter many a commander has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
saved, even though that daring should have bordered upon
rashness. In Monson’s affair, Holkar might have been arrested
on the Chumbul,—and bold measures, promptly carried out,
have proved successful in Affghanistan; but Monson retreated
when he should have held his ground, and Burnes and MacNaughten
temporized when they should have acted. A brief
notice will best sum up the disastrous finale of the Affghanistan
invasion. Burnes, in false security, was murdered—and
MacNaughten placed himself in the power of a treacherous
ruffian, and paid the penalty of his folly with his life. The
rest is a tale of perfidy, disgrace, and slaughter.</p>

<p>But yet gloomy as that miserable history is, brilliant scintillations
of British heroism were not wanting. The forcing
of the mountain passes was most creditable to Dennie, as the
defence of Jellalabad was to Sale. Both since have filled a
soldier’s grave—and braver spirits never breathed their last
upon a battle-field.</p>

<span class="subhead">BILUCHI CAMPAIGN.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Jealousy of the Scinde chieftains.—Proceedings of Sir Charles Napier.—Defeat
of the Bilúchis.</p></blockquote>

<p>For a time, affairs in Scinde, after the Cabool disasters,
looked peaceable; but the conditions proposed by new treaties
to the Amirs, in the infringements upon their game preserves,
and the abolition of transit duties, occasioned much discontent.
Gradually, this jealousy of the Scinde chieftains ripened into
hatred; and while evasive policy was resorted to by the
Amirs, a corps, under Sir Charles Napier, advanced to support
the British representative, Major Outram. The agency
had been attacked—gallantly defended—and Outram effected
an honourable retreat; while the Amirs, collecting in great
force at Fulali, Sir Charles, with his small force, determined
to attack them. An extract from his own despatch will best
describe this daring and most brilliant <span class="locked">affair:—</span></p>

<p>“On the 16th I marched to Muttaree, having there ascertained
that the Amirs were in position at Míani (ten miles’
distance), to the number of 22,000 men, and well knowing
that a delay for reinforcements would both strengthen their
confidence and add to their numbers, already seven times that
which I commanded, I resolved to attack them, and we
marched at 4 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> on the morning of the 17th; at eight
o’clock the advanced guard discovered their camp; at nine
o’clock we formed in order of battle, about 2,800 men of all
arms, and twelve pieces of artillery. We were now within
range of the enemy’s guns, and fifteen pieces of artillery
opened upon us, and were answered by our cannon. The
enemy were very strongly posted, woods were on their flanks,
which I did not think could be turned. These two woods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
were joined by the dry bed of the river Falláli, which had a
high bank. The bed of the river was nearly straight, and
about 1,200 yards in length. Behind this and in both woods
were the enemy posted. In front of their extreme right, and
on the edge of the wood, was a village. Having made the
best examination of their position which so short a time permitted,
the artillery was posted on the right of the line, and
some skirmishers of infantry, with the Scinde irregular horse,
were sent in front to try and make the enemy shew his force
more distinctly; we then advanced from the right in echellon
of battalions, refusing the left to save it from the fire of the
village. The 9th Bengal light cavalry formed the reserve in
rear of the left wing; and the Poona horse, together with
four companies of infantry, guarded the baggage. In this
order of battle we advanced as at a review across a fine plain
swept by the cannon of the enemy. The artillery and
H. M.’s 22nd regiment in line, formed the leading echellon,
the 25th N.I. the second, the 12th N.I. the third, and the
1st grenadier N.I. the fourth.</p>

<p>“The enemy was 1,100 yards from our line, which soon
traversed the intervening space. Our fire of musketry opened
at about 100 yards from the bank in reply to that of the enemy;
and in a few minutes the engagement became general along
the bank of the river, on which the combatants fought for
about three hours or more with great fury, man to man. Then,
my lord, was seen the superiority of the musket and bayonet
over the sword and shield and matchlock. The brave Bilúchis
first discharging their matchlocks and pistols, dashed over the
bank with desperate resolution; but down went these bold and
skilful swordsmen under the superior power of the musket and
bayonet. At one time, my lord, the courage and numbers of
the enemy against the 22nd, the 25th, and the 12th regiments
bore heavily in that part of the battle. There was no time to
be lost, and I sent orders to the cavalry to force the right of
the enemy’s line. This order was very gallantly executed by
the 9th Bengal cavalry and the Scinde horse; the details of
which shall be afterwards stated to your lordship, for the
struggle on our right and centre was at that moment so
fierce, that I could not go to the left.</p>

<p>“In this charge the 9th light cavalry took a standard, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
several pieces of artillery, and the Scinde horse took the
enemy’s camp, from which a vast body of their cavalry slowly
retired fighting. Lieutenant Fitzgerald gallantly pursued
them for two miles, and, I understand, slew three of the enemy
in single combat. The brilliant conduct of these two cavalry
regiments decided in my opinion the crisis of the action, for
from the moment the cavalry were seen in rear of their right
flank, the resistance of our opponents slackened; the 22nd
regiment forced the bank, the 25th and 12th did the same,
the latter regiment capturing several guns, and the victory
was decided. The artillery made great havoc among the
dense masses of the enemy, and dismounted several of their
guns. The whole of the enemy’s artillery, ammunition, standards,
and camp, with considerable stores and some treasure,
were taken.”</p>

<p>War was now regularly proclaimed—and on the 22nd of
March, the Sikhs recommenced hostilities at Mattari—Sir
Charles Napier, in the meanwhile, having effected a junction
with his reinforcements. Halting at the village of Duppa, on
the 23rd, he decided on attacking the Bilúchis on the 24th.
The enemy were in a strong position, numbering 20,000 men.
The Anglo-Indian army might amount in round numbers to
5,000, all arms included. Thus runs the <span class="locked">despatch:—</span></p>

<p>“The forces under my command marched from Hyderabad
this morning at daybreak. About half-past 8 o’clock we discovered
and attacked the army under the personal command
of the Meer Shere Mahomed, consisting of twenty thousand
men of all arms, strongly posted behind one of those large
nullahs by which this country is intersected in all directions.
After a combat of about three hours, the enemy was wholly
defeated with considerable slaughter, and the loss of all his
standards and cannon.</p>

<p>“His position was nearly a straight line; the nullah was
formed by two deep parallel ditches, one 20 feet wide and 8
feet deep, the other 42 feet wide and 17 deep, which had been
for a long distance freshly scarped, and a banquet made behind
the bank expressly for the occasion.</p>

<p>“To ascertain the strength of his line was extremely difficult,
as his left did not appear to be satisfactorily defined; but he
began moving to his right when he perceived that the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
force outflanked him in that direction. Believing that this
movement had drawn him from that part of the nullah which
had been prepared for defence, I hoped to attack his right
with less difficulty, and Major Leslie’s troop of horse artillery
was ordered to move forward and endeavour to rake the
nullah. The 9th light cavalry and Poona horse advancing
in line, on the left of the artillery, which was supported on
the right by her Majesty’s 22nd regiment, the latter being,
however, at first considerably retired to admit of the oblique
fire of Leslie’s troop. The whole of the artillery now opened
upon the enemy’s position, and the British line advanced in
echellons from the left, H. M.’s 22nd regiment leading the
attack.</p>

<p>“The enemy was now perceived to move from his centre in
considerable bodies to his left, apparently retreating, unable
to sustain the cross-fire of the British artillery; on seeing
which Major Stack, at the head of the 3rd cavalry, under
command of Captain Delamain, and the Sindh horse, under
command of Captain Jacob, made a brilliant charge upon
the enemy’s left flank, crossing the nullah and cutting down
the retreating enemy for several miles. While this was passing
on the right, H. M.’s 22nd regiment, gallantly led by Major
Poole, who commanded the brigade, and Captain George, who
commanded the corps, attacked the nullah on the left with
great gallantry, and I regret to add, with considerable loss.
This brave battalion marched up to the nullah under a heavy
fire of matchlocks, without returning a shot till within forty
paces of the intrenchment, and then stormed it like British
soldiers. The intrepid Lieutenant Coote first mounted the
rampart, seized one of the enemy’s standards, and was severely
wounded while waving it and cheering on his men.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the Poona horse, under Captain Tait, and the
9th cavalry, under Major Story, turned the enemy’s right
flank pursuing and cutting down the fugitives for several
miles. H. M.’s 22nd regiment was well supported by the
batteries commanded by Captains Willoughby and Hutt,
which crossed their fire with that of Major Leslie. Then
came the 2nd brigade under command of Major Woodburn,
bearing down into action with excellent coolness. It consisted
of the 25th, 21st, and 12th regiments, under the command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
of Captains Jackson, Stevens, and Fisher, respectively;
these regiments were strongly sustained by the fire of Captain
Whitley’s battery, on the right of which were the 8th and
1st regiments, under Majors Browne and Clibborne; these
two corps advanced with the regularity of a review up to the
intrenchments, their commanders, with considerable exertion,
stopping their fire, on seeing that a portion of the Sindh horse
and 3rd cavalry in charging the enemy had got in front of the
brigade. The battle was decided by the troop of horse artillery
and H. M.’s 22nd regiment.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SIKH CAMPAIGNS.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>State of the Punjaub.—Sir Henry Hardinge appointed governor.—Strength
and organization of the Sikh army.—Moodkee.—Ferozepore.—Defeat
of the Sikhs.—Battle of Aliwal.—Its consequences.—Sobraon.—Conclusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fatal <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dénouement</i> of the retreat from Cabool was still
in vivid colouring before the British public, when tidings from
the East announced that it might be considered only as the
forerunner of still more alarming demonstrations, and these
from a power fully as unfriendly, and far mere formidable
to English interests than the Ghiljies and fanatic tribes of
Affghanistan. The Punjaub<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> for years had been internally
convulsed. The musnud in turn was occupied by women
whose debaucheries were disgusting, and men who had
reached it by the foulest murders. The country was frightfully
disorganized—one bond of union alone existed among the
Sikhs—and that was the most deadly hostility to the British.</p>

<p>The state of things beyond the Sutlej alarmed the Indian
government, and Lord Ellenborough acted with energy and
good judgment—Scinde and Gwalior must be deprived of the
power of being mischievous—and while the former was annexed
in form to the possessions of the Company, Gwalior
was being prepared for undergoing a similar change. To give
effect to these important measures, an army of observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
marched upon the Sutlej—but long before any results from
his policy could be developed, Lord Ellenborough was recalled,
and Sir Henry Hardinge appointed to succeed him. In the
spring of 1844, the new governor reached Calcutta.</p>

<p>The Cabool disasters had rendered the very thought of
Eastern war most unpopular at home—and Sir Henry assumed
the chief command, with a full determination to avoid a rupture
with the Sikhs—could such be avoidable; but that, as events
proved, was impossible—and pacific policy was tried and
found wanting.</p>

<p>“The summer of 1845 was marked by frightful excesses in
Lahore. Murder and debauchery went hand-in-hand together;
and the Ranee herself, as well as her chief adviser,
Jowar Singh, no longer disguised their purpose of coming
to blows with the English. On the part of Jowar Singh,
this was but the prosecution of a policy which had long
been in favour with him; and as he was heartily detested by
the rest of the sirdars, they made it a pretext for conspiring
against him and putting him to death. But the Ranee was
swayed by different motives. From day to day her army
became more unmanageable; and she desired, above all things,
to get rid of the nuisance, even if her deliverance should come
with a victorious British force to Lahore. Accordingly, after
having long withstood the clamours of her officers, she gave a
hearty, yet a reluctant, consent to the proposed invasion of
the protected states; and a plan of operations was drawn up,
which indicated no slight knowledge of the art of war on the
part of those from whom it emanated.”<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p>As yet Sir Henry had avoided every appearance of angry
demonstration. Loodiana and Ferozepore were well garrisoned.
The former place was weak—the latter better calculated
for resistance. A magazine to supply both places had
been judiciously established where the Umballa road touches
that of Kurnaul—for Busseean was equally accessible to the
garrisons which were threatened.</p>

<p>Coming events had not been disregarded by the chief in
command—and in June, Sir Henry in person proceeded to
the western provinces. Approaching hostilities had in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
autumn become too evident—the Sikhs were advancing to
the Sutlej—and instead of having, as formerly reported,
15,000 men in and about Lahore, they had actually seven
divisions, which might fairly average, each with the other,
8,000 men. One of these was to remain to garrison the capital—the
remainder were disposable—and, as it was believed,
destined to attack Loodiana, Kurrachee, Ferozepore, Scinde,
and Attock.</p>

<p>Before the subsequent transactions are described, a detail of
the strength, organization, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of the Sikh army
will be interesting—and an officer,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> whose brief but lucid account
of the Punjaub, is admirably perspicuous and judiciously
condensed, thus pictures the construction of a military force,
whose local position and efficiency rendered the repression of
its formidable power imperative upon the Indian executive.</p>

<p>“This force, consisting of about 110,000 men, is divided
into regulars and irregulars; the former of whom, about
70,000 strong, are drilled and appointed according to the
European system. The cavalry branch of the disciplined
force amounts to nearly 13,000, and the infantry and artillery
to 60,000 more. The irregulars, variously armed and
equipped, are nearly 40,000 strong, of which number upwards
of 20,000 are cavalry, the remainder consisting of infantry
and matchlock-men, while the contingents, which the sirdars
or chiefs are obliged to parade on the requisition of the
sovereign, amount to considerably above 30,000 more. The
artillery consisted in Runjeet’s time of 376 guns, and 370
swivels mounted on camels or on light carriages adapted to
their size. There is no distinct corps of artillery as in other
services, but there are 4,000 or 5,000 men, under a daroga,
trained to the duty of gunners, and these are distributed with
the ordnance throughout the regular army. The costume of
the regular infantry is scarlet, with different coloured facings,
to distinguish regiments, as in the British service. The
trousers are of blue linen; the head-dress is a blue turban,
with one end loose, and spread so as to entirely cover the
head, back of the neck, and shoulders; the belts are of black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
leather; the arms a musket and bayonet, the manufacture of
Lahore. The cavalry wear helmets or steel caps, round
which shawls or scarfs are folded. The <em>irregulars</em>, in their
dress and appointments, fully justify the appellation which
their habits and mode of making war obtained for them.
Cotton, silk, or broad cloth tunics of various colours, with the
addition of shawls, cloaks, breastplates, or coats of mail,
with turban or helmets, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad libitum</i>, impart to them a motley
but picturesque appearance. They are all badly mounted,
and, indeed, little can be said even of the regular cavalry in
this respect. The Punjaub breed of horses is far from good,
and they do not import stock from other countries to improve
their own cattle. The pay of the sepoys of the regular army
of the Punjaub is higher than that of the same class in the
army of the East-India Company, each common soldier
receiving ten rupees per mensem. The troops of the irregulars
receive twenty-five rupees each, out of which they provide
their arms and clothing, and feed their horse, putting the
government to no other expense whatever for their services.</p>

<p>“Enlistment in the regular army of the Punjaub is quite
voluntary, and the service is so popular that the army could
upon an emergency be increased to almost any amount. The
soldiery are exceedingly apt in acquiring a knowledge of their
military duties; but they are so averse to control that
instances of insubordination are common; latterly, indeed,
open mutiny has frequently characterized the relations of
officer and soldier. Insubordination is punished—when
punishment is practicable—with confinement, loss of pay, or
extra duty. But in the present state of military disorganization
no means of chastising rebellion are available.</p>

<p>“No pensions were, or are, assigned to the soldiery for long
service, nor is there any provision for the widows and families
of those who die, or are killed in the service of the state.
Promotions, instead of being the right of the good soldier in
order of seniority, or the reward of merit in the various
grades, is frequently effected by bribery. In the higher
ranks, advancement is obtained by the judicious application of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">douceurs</i> to the palm of the favourites at court, or the
military chieftains about the person of the sovereign. In the
event of the government of the Punjaub falling into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
hands of the British, some time would probably elapse before
the dissolute rabble which now composes the army could be
brought under a state of as perfect discipline as that which
exists in the Anglo-Indian army; but there is no doubt that
ultimately the result of a system, strict and severe from the
commencement, when supported by a stern and absolute
monarchy, would display itself, and render the Sikh troops as
devoted a body as the regular native army of Hindostan.
Only twenty-three years have elapsed since the military force
in the Punjaub consisted of a large and undisciplined horde.
In 1822, the first European officers presented themselves
(according to Prinsep) at Runjeet Singh’s durbar, seeking
military service and entertainment. These were Messrs.
Allard and Ventura, who had served in the French army
until the annihilation of Napoleon Buonaparte deprived them
of employment. At first, Runjeet Singh, with the suspicion
common to a native Indian prince, received them coldly; and
his distrust of their purposes was heightened by the Punjaubee
chieftains, who were naturally jealous of the introduction of
Europeans into the military service; but a submissive and
judicious letter from these officers removed the apprehensions
of the Maharajah, and he, with the spirit and originality of a
man of genius, admitted them into his service; appointing
them instructors of his troops in the European system of drill
and warfare. The good conduct and wise management of
these gentlemen speedily removed Runjeet Singh’s prejudices
against Europeans; and the door to employment being
thrown open, several military men entered the service of the
Maharajah, and at the close of his reign there were not less
than a dozen receiving his pay, and, to use an Indian
expression, ‘eating his salt.’ The successors of Runjeet
Singh, however, did not look with an eye of favour upon men
who were not to be bought, and whose sense of personal
dignity revolted at the treatment to which the unbridled Sikh
chieftains were inclined to subject them. The greater part
accordingly resigned their commissions; some of them
retiring with ample fortunes, and others seeking honourable
employment elsewhere.</p>

<p>“The Sikh army, until lately, was considered by many
British officers, who had the opportunity of seeing it, to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
been in a fair state of discipline. They form very correct
lines, but in manœuvring their movements are too slow, and
they would, in consequence, be in danger, from a body of
British cavalry, of being successfully charged during a change
of position. They would also run the risk of having their
flanks turned by their inability to follow the motion of an
European enemy with equal rapidity.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></p>

<p>“The arms, that is to say, the muskets, are of very inferior
stamp, incapable of throwing a ball to any distance, and on
quick and repeated discharges liable to burst. Their firing is
bad, owing to the very small quantity of practice ammunition
allowed by the government; not more than ten balls out of a
hundred, at the distance of as many paces, would probably tell
upon an enemy’s ranks. They still preserve the old system
of three ranks, the front one kneeling when firing and then
rising to load, a method in action liable to create confusion.</p>

<p>“In person, the infantry soldiers are tall and thin, with good
features and full beards; their superior height is owing to the
extraordinary length of their lower limbs. They are capable
of enduring the fatigue of long marches for several days in
succession (the author having on one occasion marched with
his regiment a distance of 300 miles within twelve days), and
are, generally speaking, so hardy that exposure to oppressive
heats or heavy rains has little effect upon them. In a great
measure this is the result of custom. Excepting in the
vicinity of Lahore and Peshawur, there are few regular
quarters or cantonments; the men occupy small tents or
caravanserais.</p>

<p>“The drum and fife and bugle are in general use in the
Sikh infantry regiments, and in some of the favourite royal
corps of Runjeet Singh an attempt was made to introduce
a band of music, but a graft of European melody upon
Punjaubee discord did not produce, as may be imagined, a
very harmonious result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
“The cavalry of the Sikh army is very inferior in every
respect to the infantry. While the latter are carefully picked
from large bodies of candidates for service, the former are
composed of men of all sorts and sizes and ages, who get
appointed solely through the interests of the different sirdars.
They are mean-looking, ill-dressed, and, as already stated,
wretchedly mounted. Their horse trappings are of leather of
the worst quality, and their saddles are of the same miserable
material, and badly constructed. When the horse is in
motion, the legs and arms of the rider wave backwards and
forwards, right and left, by way, as it were, of keeping time
with the pace of the animal bestridden. The horses are
small, meagre, and ill-shaped, with the aquiline nose which
so peculiarly proclaims inferiority of breed. In the field, the
conduct of Sikh cavalry has generally corresponded with
their appearance and efficiency. They are totally deficient of
firmness in the hour of struggle, and only charge the foe
when a vast superiority of numerical force gives them a
sort of warranty of success.”</p>

<p>Undeceived touching the supposed weakness of the Sikh
army, Sir Henry Hardinge, in conjunction with his gallant
superior in command, Sir Hugh Gough, concentrated his
troops, called for reinforcements from the interior, added
largely to his commissariate—and what in Eastern warfare is
altogether indispensable, largely increased his beasts of burden
and means of transport. Then taking a central position,
he waited calmly and prudently until the Sikh designs should
be more clearly developed.</p>

<p>November came—the storm had been gathering—remonstrances
from the governor-general had failed—and on the
4th, the Sikh vakeel was formally dismissed. Still immediate
hostilities were not anticipated—when suddenly, news
arrived on the 13th, that the enemy had crossed the Sutlej,
and Ferozepore was invested. The British commander
hurried by forced marches to its relief—and on the 18th, after a
seven leagues’ march, at noon the Anglo-Indian array reached
the village of Moodkee.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> A movement of twenty miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
under an eastern sun is most distressing—and the wearied
troops having bivouacked, ignorant of the proximity of an
enemy, cut wood, lighted fires, and commenced cooking.
Strange as it may appear, although in the immediate presence
of the Sikh army, no vidette had seen it, and the booming
of the enemy’s guns first gave note of preparation.</p>

<p>“The army was in a state of great exhaustion, principally
from the want of water, which was not procurable on the
road, when about three <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, information was received that
the Sikh army was advancing; and the troops had scarcely
time to get under arms and move to their positions, when that
fact was ascertained.</p>

<p>“I immediately,” says Lord Gough, “pushed forward the
horse artillery and cavalry, directing the infantry, accompanied
by the field batteries, to move forward in support. We had
not proceeded beyond two miles, when we found the enemy in
position. They were said to consist of from 15,000 to 20,000
infantry, about the same force of cavalry, and forty guns.
They evidently had either just taken up this position, or
were advancing in order of battle against us.</p>

<p>“To resist their attack, and to cover the formation of the
infantry, I advanced the cavalry under Brigadiers White,
Gough, and Mactier, rapidly to the front, in columns of
squadrons, and occupied the plain. They were speedily followed
by the five troops of horse artillery, under Brigadier
Brooke, who took up a forward position, having the cavalry
then on his flanks.</p>

<p>“The country is a dead flat, covered at short intervals with
a low, but in some places, thick jhow jungle and dotted with
sandy hillocks. The enemy screened their infantry and artillery
behind this jungle and such undulations as the ground
afforded; and, whilst our twelve battalions formed from
echellon of brigade into line, opened a very severe cannonade
upon our advancing troops, which was vigorously replied to
by the battery of horse artillery under Brigadier Brooke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
which was soon joined by the two light field batteries. The
rapid and well-directed fire of our artillery appeared soon to
paralyze that of the enemy; and, as it was necessary to complete
our infantry dispositions without advancing the artillery
too near to the jungle, I directed the cavalry under Brigadiers
White and Gough to make a flank movement on the
enemy’s left, with a view of threatening and turning that
flank, if possible. With praiseworthy gallantry, the 3rd light
dragoons, with the 2nd brigade of cavalry, consisting of the
body-guard and fifth light cavalry, with a portion of the
4th lancers, turned the left of the Sikh army, and, sweeping
along the whole rear of its infantry and guns, silenced for a
time the latter, and put their numerous cavalry to flight.
Whilst this movement was taking place on the enemy’s left,
I directed the remainder of the 4th lancers, the 9th irregular
cavalry, under Brigadier Mactier, with a light field battery,
to threaten their right. This manœuvre was also successful.
Had not the infantry and guns of the enemy been screened by
the jungle, these brilliant charges of the cavalry would have
been productive of greater effect.</p>

<p>“When the infantry advanced to the attack. Brigadier Brooke
rapidly pushed on his horse artillery close to the jungle, and
the cannonade was resumed on both sides. The infantry,
under Major-Generals Sir Harry Smith, Gilbert, and Sir
John M’Caskill, attacked in echellon of lines the enemy’s
infantry, almost invisible amongst the wood and the approaching
darkness of night. The opposition of the enemy was
such as might have been expected from troops who had every
thing at stake, and who had long vaunted of being irresistible.
Their ample and extended line, from their great superiority of
numbers, far outflanked ours; but this was counteracted by
the flank movements of our cavalry. The attack of the
infantry now commenced; and the roll of fire from this
powerful arm soon convinced the Sikh army that they had
met with a foe they little expected; and their whole force
was driven from position after position with great slaughter,
and the loss of seventeen pieces of artillery, some of them of
heavy calibre; our infantry using that never-failing weapon,
the bayonet, whenever the enemy stood. Night only saved
them from worse disaster, for this stout conflict was maintained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
during an hour and a half of dim starlight, amidst a cloud
of dust from the sandy plain, which yet more obscured every
object.</p>

<p>“I regret to say, this gallant and successful attack was
attended with considerable loss; the force bivouacked upon
the field for some hours, and only returned to its encampment
after ascertaining that it had no enemy before it, and
that night prevented the possibility of a regular advance in
pursuit.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p>In this brilliant and sanguinary battle, the British loss was
necessarily heavy. Sir Robert Sale, and Sir John M’Caskill
were killed—and Brigadiers Bolton and Mactier, with
Colonels Byrne and Bunbury, wounded. The total casualties
amounted to 872 of all arms.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more fortunate than the <em>prestige</em>
which Moodkee gave to the campaign. One damning fault of
the Spanish generals on the Peninsula, was that they literally
overmarched their troops until they came to a dead stand-still—and
this the British commanders most judiciously
avoided.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> A little delay in active operations was, under circumstances,
particularly politic—for while the Sikhs were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
shaken in confidence, and marvelling at their discomfiture, the
British lion was gathering strength to make another and a
deadlier spring.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st, the Anglo-Indian army again
took the offensive, and marched against the intrenched position
of the enemy—and the details of the succeeding events of that
bloody and glorious day are thus lucidly and modestly given.</p>

<p>“Instead of advancing to the direct attack of their formidable
works, our force manœuvred to their right; the second
and fourth divisions of infantry, in front, supported by the
first division and cavalry in second line, continued to defile
for some time out of cannon-shot between the Sikhs and
Ferozepore. The desired effect was not long delayed, a
cloud of dust was seen on our left, and according to the
instructions sent him on the preceding evening, Major-General
Sir John Littler, with his division, availing himself of
the offered opportunity, was discovered in full march to unite
his force with mine. The junction was soon effected, and
thus was accomplished one of the great objects of all our
harassing marches and privations, in the relief of this division
of our army from the blockade of the numerous forces by
which it was surrounded.</p>

<p>“Dispositions were now made for a united attack on the
enemy’s intrenched camp. We found it to be a parallelogram
of about a mile in length and half a mile in breadth,
including within its area the strong village of Ferozeshah;
the shorter sides looking towards the Sutlej and Moodkee,
and the longer towards Ferozepore and the open country.
We moved against the last-named face, the ground in front
of which was, like the Sikh position in Moodkee, covered
with low jungle.</p>

<p>“The divisions of Major-General Sir John Littler, Brigadier
Wallace (who had succeeded Major-General Sir John
M’Caskill), and Major-General Gilbert, deployed into line,
having in the centre our whole force of artillery, with the
exception of three troops of horse artillery, one on either
flank, and one in support, to be moved as occasion required.
Major-General Sir Harry Smith’s division, and our small
cavalry force, moved in second line, having a brigade in
reserve to cover each wing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
“I should here observe, that I committed the charge and
direction of the left wing to Lieut.-Gen. Sir Henry Hardinge,
while I personally conducted the right.</p>

<p>“A very heavy cannonade was opened by the enemy, who
had dispersed over their position upwards of 100 guns, more
than 40 of which were of battering calibre; these kept up a
heavy and well-directed fire, which the practice of our far
less numerous artillery, of much lighter metal, checked in
some degree, but could not silence; finally, in the face of a
storm of shot and shell, our infantry advanced and carried
these formidable intrenchments; they threw themselves
upon the guns, and with matchless gallantry wrested them
from the enemy; but, when the batteries were partially
within our grasp, our soldiery had to face such a fire of musketry
from the Sikh infantry, arrayed behind their guns,
that, in spite of the most heroic efforts, a portion only of the
intrenchment could be carried. Night fell while the conflict
was everywhere raging.</p>

<p>“Although I now brought up Major-General Sir Harry
Smith’s division, and he captured and long retained another
point of the position, and her Majesty’s 3rd light dragoons
charged and took some of the most formidable batteries, yet
the enemy remained in possession of a considerable portion of
the great quadrangle, whilst our troops, intermingled with
theirs, kept possession of the remainder, and finally bivouacked
upon it, exhausted by their gallant efforts, greatly
reduced in numbers, and suffering extremely from thirst, yet
animated by an indomitable spirit. In this state of things
the long night wore away.</p>

<p>“Near the middle of it one of their heavy guns was advanced,
and played with deadly effect upon our troops. Lieutenant-General
Sir Henry Hardinge immediately formed her Majesty’s
80th foot and the 1st European light infantry. They
were led to the attack by their commanding officers, and
animated in their exertions by Lieut.-Colonel Wood (aide-de-camp
to the lieut.-general), who was wounded in the onset.
The 80th captured the gun, and the enemy, dismayed by
this counter-check, did not venture to press on further.
During the whole night, however, they continued to harass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
our troops by fire of artillery, wherever moonlight discovered
our position.</p>

<p>“But with daylight of the 22nd came retribution. Our
infantry formed line, supported on both flanks by horse
artillery, whilst a fire was opened from our centre by such of
our heavy guns as remained effective, aided by a flight of
rockets. A masked battery played with great effect upon this
point, dismounting our pieces, and blowing up our tumbrils.
At this moment, Lieut.-General Sir Henry Hardinge placed
himself at the head of the left, whilst I rode at the head of
the right wing.</p>

<p>“Our line advanced, and, unchecked by the enemy’s fire,
drove them rapidly out of the village of Ferozeshah and their
encampment; then, changing front to its left, on its centre,
our force continued to sweep the camp, bearing down all opposition,
and dislodged the enemy from their whole position.
The line then halted, as if on a day of manœuvre, receiving
its two leaders as they rode along its front with a gratifying
cheer, and displaying the captured standards of the Khalsa
army. We had taken upwards of seventy-three pieces of
cannon, and were masters of the whole field.</p>

<p>“The force assumed a position on the ground which it had
won, but even here its labours were not to cease. In the
course of two hours, Sirdar Tej Singh, who had commanded in
the last great battle, brought up from the vicinity of Ferozepore
fresh battalions and a large field of artillery, supported
by 30,000 Ghorepurras, hitherto encamped near the river.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
He drove in our cavalry parties, and made strenuous efforts
to regain the position at Ferozeshah; this attempt was defeated;
but its failure had scarcely become manifest, when
the sirdar renewed the contest with more troops and a large
artillery. He commenced by a combination against our left
flank; and when this was frustrated, made such a demonstration
against the captured villages as compelled us to change
our whole front to the right. His guns during this manœuvre
maintained an incessant fire, whilst our artillery ammunition
being completely expended in these protracted combats, we
were unable to answer him with a single shot.</p>

<p>“I now directed our almost exhausted cavalry to threaten
both flanks at once, preparing the infantry to advance in
support, which apparently caused him suddenly to cease his
fire, and abandon the field.</p>

<p>“For twenty-four hours not a Sikh has appeared in our front.
The remains of the Khalsa army are said to be in full retreat
across the Sutlej, at Nuggurputhur and Tella, or marching
up its left bank towards Hurreekeeputhur, in the greatest
confusion and dismay. Of their chiefs, Bahadur Singh is
killed; Lal Singh said to be wounded; Mehtab Singh,
Adjoodhia Pershad, and Tej Singh, the late governor of
Peshawur, have fled with precipitation. Their camp is the
scene of the most awful carnage, and they have abandoned
large stores of grain, camp equipage, and ammunition.</p>

<p>“Thus has apparently terminated this unprovoked and criminal
invasion of the peaceful provinces under British protection.</p>

<p>“On the conclusion of such a narrative as I have given, it is
surely superfluous in me to say, that I am, and shall be to
the last moment of my existence, proud of the army which I
had to command on the 21st and 22nd instant. To their
gallant exertions I owe the satisfaction of seeing such a
victory achieved, and the glory of having my own name
associated with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
“The loss of this army has been heavy;<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> how could a hope
be formed that it should be otherwise? Within thirty hours
this force stormed an intrenched camp, fought a general action,
and sustained two considerable combats with the enemy.
Within four days it has dislodged from their positions, on the
left bank of the Sutlej, 60,000 Sikh soldiers, supported by
upwards of 150 pieces of cannon, 108 of which the enemy
acknowledge to have lost, and 91 of which are in our possession.</p>

<p>“In addition to our losses in the battle, the captured camp
was found to be everywhere protected by charged mines, by
the successive springing of which many brave officers and
men have been destroyed.”<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>These glorious battles were within a month followed up by
that of Aliwal—as sanguinary an affair as either of its
predecessors, and, in a military point of view, decidedly more
scientific in arrangement and execution. In one operation, it
seemed a pendant to the beautiful movement on the retreat
from Burgos, when Wellington carried his army bodily round
Souham’s, and placed the French general in the afternoon, in
the same unfavourable position in which he, Wellington, had
found himself that morning. The action had not been
expected—for the service required had been effected without
resistance.</p>

<p>“Though the treaty which held the English and Sikh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
governments in amity provided that the Sikhs should send
no troops across the Sutlej, they were permitted to retain
certain jaghires, or feudal possessions, on the left bank, one of
which comprised the town and fort of Dheerrumcote. Here
the enemy had established a magazine of grain; and a small
garrison, consisting of mercenaries, chiefly Rohillas and
Affghans, were thrown into the place for its protection. But
besides that the grain was needed in the British lines, the
presence of a hostile garrison on his own side of the stream
was an eyesore and an annoyance to the British general,—and
Major-General Sir Harry Smith was directed, with
a brigade of infantry and a few guns, to reduce it. He
accomplished the service on the 18th of January without loss,
or, indeed, sustaining a serious resistance; and was on his
way back to camp, when tidings reached the commander-in-chief
of a nature not to be dealt lightly with, far less
neglected. It was ascertained that the enemy had detached
20,000 men from their camp at Sobraon against Loodiana.
Their objects were represented to be, not only the seizure of
that place, but the interruption of the British communications
with the rear, and, perhaps, the capture of the battering train,
which was advancing by Busseean; and Sir Harry
Smith, being reinforced to the amount of 8,000 men, received
instructions to counterwork the project. His business was to
form a junction with Colonel Godby, who, with one regiment
of cavalry and four of infantry, occupied Loodiana; and
then, and not till then, to push the Sikhs, and drive them, if
possible, back upon their own country.”<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>Here, again, the school in which he had been taught his
trade was evidenced in the conduct of the commander, who
proved in his hour of trial that Peninsular instruction had
not been thrown away. The Sikhs had already shut the
garrison of Loodiana in—burned a new barrack, and ravaged
the surrounding country—a creeping commander now would
have been found wanting—but Smith was a man of different
metal—and, pushing rapidly on, a clean march brought him
within twenty-five miles of Loodiana—and with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réveil</i>—he
resumed his movement next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
At Buddewal the enemy shewed himself, occupying a
connected line of villages in front, and covered by a powerful
artillery. To gain his object, and reach Loodiana, it
was necessary for Sir Harry Smith to change his order
of march—and while the Sikhs, who had already outflanked
him, opened a fire of forty guns on the advancing columns,
Smith massed his weak artillery, and under its concentrated
and well-directed cannonade, broke into <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">échelons</i>, and
threatened the Sikh front, the while making a flank movement
by his right, protected <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en échelon</i> by the cavalry. Nothing
could be more beautifully and successfully executed than
this delicate manœuvre. Sir Harry carried his guns and
baggage round the enemy—a small portion only of the latter
passing into the temporary possession of the Sikhs.</p>

<p>“Colonel Godby, who commanded the invested garrison,
having seen the cloud of dust, moved from Loodiana; and
marching parallel to the direction which it seemed to take,
found himself in due time connected by his patrols with
Smith’s advanced guard. Both corps upon this placed
themselves with Loodiana in their rear, and the enemy before
them; the latter being so circumstanced, that the British
army lay, as it were, upon one of its flanks. But Smith,
though he had thus relieved the town, was unwilling to strike
a blow till he could make it decisive. He, therefore, encamped
in an attitude of watchfulness, waiting till another brigade
should arrive, which, under the command of Colonel Wheeler,
was marching from head-quarters to reinforce him.”</p>

<p>Colonel Wheeler’s march seems to have been conducted
with equal diligence and care. He heard of the encounter of
the 21st, and of its results; whereupon he abandoned the
direct road to Loodiana, and following a circuitous route, went
round the enemy’s position, without once coming under fire.
He reached Sir Harry Smith’s camp in safety; and, on the
26th, Smith made his preparations to fight a great battle.
But it was found, ere the columns were put in motion, that
the enemy had abandoned their position at Buddewal, and
were withdrawn to an intrenched camp nearer to the river, of
which the village of Aliwal was the key, covering the ford
by which they had crossed, and on which they depended, in
the event of a reverse, as a line of retreat. Operations were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
accordingly suspended, and such further arrangements set
going as the altered state of affairs seemed to require.</p>

<p>On the 27th, Runjoor Singh having been reinforced by
Avitabile’s brigade, 4,000 Sikh regulars, some cavalry and
twelve guns, found himself, as he had reason to believe, in
a condition to deliver battle—and to intercept the Anglo-Indian
communications, he advanced towards Ingraon—where
early on the 28th, Sir Harry Smith found him in position.
His right rested on a height, his left on a field intrenchment,
while his centre held ground in the immediate front of the
village of Aliwal (or Ulleéwal). The Anglo-Indian army
amounted to some 12,000 men of all arms—the Sikhs doubled
them in numerical strength, and that too was composed of the
flower of their army.</p>

<p>The subsequent details of this glorious action may be
rapidly described. Smith boldly advanced against the Sikh
position, under a heavy cannonade, while the right brigades
were getting into line. The advance was splendid—the
British cavalry driving the Sikh horsemen on their infantry,
forced the left back, capturing several guns, while on the
left of the British line, the Ayeen brigade (Avitabile’s) were
deforced—and the village of Bhoondi, where the right of the
Sikhs endeavoured to make a stand, was carried with the
bayonet. A general rout ensued—the enemy pressing in
confused masses towards the ford, while every attempt they
made to rally was anticipated by a charge, and the destruction
of the flower of the Sikh army was completed.</p>

<p>“The firing began about ten in the morning; by one
o’clock in the day the Sikh army was broken and routed, the
ground covered with its wreck, and the Sutlej choked with
the dead and the dying. The whole of the artillery, fifty-seven
guns, fell into the hands of the victors, and the booty
was immense; but the victors had neither time nor inclination
to dwell upon their triumphs. There was no further danger
to be apprehended here. Of the 24,000 men who, in the
morning, threatened Loodiana, scarcely as many hundreds
held together; and these, after a brief show of rally on the
opposite bank, melted away and disappeared entirely. Having
bivouacked that night, therefore, on the field which he
had won, and sent in the wounded, with the captured guns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
under sufficient escort, to Loodiana, Sir Harry Smith, with
the bulk of his division, took the road to head-quarters; and,
in the afternoon of the 8th of February, came into position
on the right of the main army, which was his established
post.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<p>In this most glorious battle, the Anglo-Indian army had
151 men killed, 413 wounded, and 25 missing,—a loss comparatively
small.</p>

<p>The immediate consequences of the victory of Aliwal, was
the evacuation of the left bank of the Sutlej by the enemy.
The Sikhs had sustained three terrible defeats; they had lost
an enormous quantity of military <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i>, 150 guns, and
none could presume to estimate the number of their best and
bravest troops who had been placed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. In
hundreds, the slaughtered and drowned victims at Aliwal
floated to Sobraon with the stream; but still with a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête
de pont</i> to secure their bridge-communications with the right
bank and the reserve there, formidable intrenchments, armed
with seventy heavy guns, and 30,000 of their best troops (the
Khalsa), they determined to defend them, boldly held their
ground, and dared another battle.</p>

<p>On being rejoined by Sir Harry Smith’s division, and having
received his siege-train and a supply of ammunition from Delhi,
the commander-in-chief and the governor-general determined
to force the Sikh position. Unopposed, they gained possession
of Little Sobraon and Kodeewalla—and both the field batteries
and heavy guns were planted to throw a concentrated fire
upon the intrenchments occupied by the enemy. Close to the
river bank, Dick’s division was stationed to assault the Sikh
right—while another brigade was held in reserve behind the
village of Kodeewalla. In the centre, Gilbert’s division was
formed, either for attack or support, its right flank <em>appuied</em>
on the village of Little Sobraon. Smith’s division took ground
near the village of Guttah, with its right inclining towards
the Sutlej—Cureton’s brigade observed the ford at Hurree,
and held Lai Singh’s horsemen in check—the remainder of
the cavalry, under Major-General Thackwell, acting in reserve.
The British batteries opened a lively cannonade soon after sunrise—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
guns, in field position, have little chance of silencing
artillery covered by strong redoubts. At nine, the attack
commenced by Stacy’s brigade of Dick’s division, advancing
against the enemy’s intrenchments. The crushing fire of the
Sikh guns would have arrested the advance of any but most
daring regiments—but the brigadier pressed gallantly on—and
while the British bayonet met the Mussulman sabre, the camp
was carried. The sappers broke openings in the intrenching
mounds, through which, although in single files, the
cavalry pushed, reformed, and charged. The Sikh gunners
were sabred in their batteries—while the entire of the infantry,
and every disposal gun—were promptly brought into
action by Sir Hugh Gough. The Sikh fire became more
feeble—their best battalions unsteady—and the British pressed
boldly on. Wavering troops rarely withstand a struggle,
when the bayonet comes into play—and the Khalsas broke
entirely, and hurried from the field to the river and bridge.
But the hour of retributive vengeance had arrived—and
the waters of the Sutlej offered small protection to the fugitives.
The stream had risen—the fords were unsafe—and
flying from the fire of the horse-artillery, which had opened
on the mobbed fugitives with grape shot, hundreds fell under
this murderous cannonade, while thousands found a grave in
the no longer friendly waters of their native river—until it
almost excited the compassion of an irritated enemy.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p>At Sobraon, the final blow which extinguished the military
power of the Sikhs, was delivered. Sixty-seven pieces of
artillery, two hundred camel-guns, standards, tumbrils, ammunition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
camp equipage—in a word, all that forms the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> of an army in the field, fell into the hands of the
victors. In native armies, no regular returns of the killed
and wounded are made out—but the Sikh losses were computed
at 8,000 men—and the amount was not exaggerated.</p>

<p>On the bloody height of Sobraon, the Sikh war virtually
terminated—for, on that evening, the Anglo-Indian army commenced
their march upon Lahore. Frightfully defeated, and
humbled to the dust, the once haughty chiefs sent vakeels to
implore mercy from the conqueror. The ambassadors, however,
were refused an audience—and it was intimated that the
British generals would condescend to treat with none except
the maha-rajah in person. Trembling for his capital, which
nothing but abject submission now could save, the youthful
monarch, attended by Rajah Goolab Singh, repaired to the
British camp. Stringent terms were most justly exacted—and
while the rich district between the Sutlej and the Beeas,
and what were termed “the Protected States,” were ceded for
ever to Britain, a million and a half sterling was agreed to by
the Sikh durbar, as compensation for the expenditure of the
war, while the Punjaub should remain in military occupation,
until the full amount should be discharged.</p>

<p>Even the Peninsular campaigns did not open under gloomier
auspices and close more gloriously, than that beyond the
Indus—and Maienee, Dubba, Moodkee, Ferozepore, Aliwal,
and Sobraon, were destined to close for the present the
glorious roll of—<span class="smcap">British Victories</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">STORMING OF SAN SEBASTIAN.</p></blockquote>

<p>The engineer officer<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> who led the column to assault the
breach was badly wounded; and after witnessing the retreat
of the assailants, thus describes the subsequent <span class="locked">events:—</span></p>

<p>“My attention,” he says, “a short time afterwards, was
aroused by an exclamation from the soldier lying next to me,—‘Oh,
they are murdering us all!’ Upon looking up, I
perceived a number of French grenadiers, under a heavy fire
of grape, sword in hand, stepping over the dead, and stabbing
the wounded; my companion was treated in the same manner;
the sword withdrawn from his body, and reeking with
his blood, was raised to give me the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de grace</i>, when
fortunately the uplifted arm was arrested by a smart little
man, a serjeant, who cried out, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Oh, mon Colonel, êtes-vous
blessé!</i>’ and immediately ordered some of his men to remove
me into the town. They raised me in their arms, and carried
me, without the slightest difficulty, up the breach on to the
ramparts of the right flanking tower; here we were stopped by
a captain of the grenadiers, who asked some questions, then
kissed me, and desired the party to proceed to the hospital.
On passing the embrasures of the high curtain, we were exposed
to a very sharp musketry fire from the trenches; and
here it was that we met the governor and his staff in full-dress
uniforms, hurrying to the breach. He asked me if I was
badly wounded, and directed that proper care should be taken
of me.”</p>

<p>A fortunate mistake thus saved the gallant subaltern,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
a blue uniform and gold bullion epaulette, indirectly became
the means of his preservation.</p>

<p>Treated coarsely by a drunken officer, who tore his sword
and belt away, Colonel Jones was carried to the hospital.
A French soldier was instantly turned out of bed to accommodate
the prisoner. He was dressed skilfully by the surgeons,
visited by the governor, and received generally the kindest
treatment. His wounds were speedily convalescent, and in a
few days he was enabled to move into the gallery running
round the court-yard of the hospital, which was a house of
considerable size, built in the usual Spanish style, having a
court-yard in the centre, with a large entrance-door from the
street—galleries from each story running round it, into which
all the doors and windows of the rooms respectively opened,
excepting on the side of the street.</p>

<p>From the height of the buildings the prospect was almost
limited to the sky,—while within, the convalescent had scenes
presented which generally are not obtruded on those who have
themselves been sufferers.</p>

<p>“One day, whilst sitting in the gallery, I observed a table
placed in the one below me, and on the opposite side of the
court-yard; immediately afterwards, an unfortunate French
gunner was laid upon it, and both his arms amputated, his
hands having been blown off by an accident in one of the batteries.
In the course of the morning, whilst conversing with
the surgeon who had performed the operation, he told me that
he acted contrary to his instructions, which were, never to amputate,
but to cure if possible. And upon asking the reason
for such an inhuman order having been issued, his reply was
the emperor did not wish that numbers of mutilated men
should be sent back to France, as it would make a bad impression
upon the people. I replied, ‘You must be a bold man
to act in opposition to this order.’ He said, ‘Affairs are beginning
to change, and, moreover, circumstances make it
necessary that the soldiers should know they will be taken
proper care of in the event of being wounded, and not left to
die like dogs; we send as many as we can at night to Bayonne
by the boats—thus we clear out the hospitals, and are
relieved from a great deal of labour.’”</p>

<p>In the course of Colonel Jones’s conversation with French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
officers, many facts which transpired shewed the terrific outrages
on moral principle involved in Napoleon’s theory of
making “war support war.” One example illustrates the
practice.</p>

<p>“In discoursing about the expeditions that detachments of
their troops frequently made from the great stations, for a
period of eighteen or twenty days, I inquired how they managed
to provision them for so long a time. The answer was,
‘Our biscuits are made with a hole in the centre, and each
biscuit is the ration for a day; sometimes twenty are delivered
to each individual, who is given to understand that he has no
claims upon the commissariat for the number of days corresponding
with the number of biscuits he receives.’ I observed
it was not possible for the soldier to carry them. ‘We know
that very well; but then he has no claim upon the government
for that period, and we do not inquire how he lives in the
interim!’”</p>

<p>Now mark the consequences of this infernal system, as it
was gathered from the same authorities. “They detailed acts
committed by their soldiers in Spain, so revolting to human
nature, that I dare not commit them to paper; the reader
would be disgusted with the recital, and my veracity impeached;
and equally incredulous should I have been, had not
the narrators declared they had witnessed the scenes which
they had described.”</p>

<p>It is certain that during the conduct of the Peninsular campaign,
the espionage employed on both sides was most extensive,—and
like melo-dramatic farce, occasionally diversified
the more serious business of the piece enacting. In the humblest
individuals the most effective agents were sometimes
found. A barber and a priest enabled Lord Wellington to
cross the Douro; and as humble an individual might have
opened the entrance into San Sebastian, sealed as it was
against a victorious army and means never exceeded by any
general who had ever sat down before a fortress,—had fortune
only permitted another barber’s agency to have been carried
into effect. “From my first entrance into the hospital, I had
been attended by a Spanish barber, in whose house a French
officer was billeted. As I could speak Spanish fluently, we
had a great deal of conversation. He used to communicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
to me all he heard and saw of what was passing both inside
and outside the fortress. When he learnt that I was an
engineer, he offered to bring me a plan of all the under-ground
drains and aqueducts for bringing water into the town.
Monsieur Joliffe, our attendant, although a good-natured man,
kept a sharp eye on the barber; and in consequence, it was
difficult for him to give me any thing without being detected.
At last, one morning, when preparing for the operation of
shaving me, he succeeded in shoving a plan under the bedclothes.
I anxiously seized the earliest opportunity of examining
it; and, from the knowledge I had previously acquired
of the place, soon became acquainted with the directions
of the drains, &amp;c. From that moment my whole attention was
fixed on the means of making my escape. I knew that the
hospital was situated in the principal street, the ends of which
terminated upon the fortifications bounding the harbour or the
sea. If once I could gain the street, I had only to turn to the
right or left to gain the ramparts, and to make my escape
from the town in the best manner I could. One evening just
at dusk, when the medical men took leave of us for the night,
one of them left his cocked hat on my bed. As soon as I
made the discovery, I put it on my head, hurried down stairs,
and made direct for the great door. I found it so completely
blocked up by the guard, that unless by pushing them aside,
it was not possible to pass without being discovered; I therefore
retreated up stairs in despair, and threw the hat down on
the bed. Scarcely had I done so, when in rushed the doctor,
inquiring for his lost <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chapeau</i>.”</p>

<p>As I have alluded to the unscrupulous means resorted to to
obtain information, I may apprize you here, that it was a
matter of surprise to all who were not aware of the extensive
espionage employed on both sides, how accurately Lord Wellington
and the French marshals to whom he was opposed
were acquainted with the objects and the capabilities of each
other. At Lisbon, many persons in immediate connection with
the Regency were more than suspected of holding a correspondence
with the French; and their treachery was encouraged
by the culpable misconduct of the Portuguese government in
not punishing criminals whose treasons had been established
beyond a question. The English newspapers were regularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
transmitted from Paris by Napoleon; and they teemed with
intelligence mischievously correct, and that too, from the head-quarters
of the Allied army;—and though a circumstance of
rare occurrence—if an intimation of what he intended to
attempt escaped from Lord Wellington’s lips to the Spaniards
with whom he was in communication, through the indiscretion
of these individuals it was sure to reach the enemy. He
says, writing to his brother,—“I apprized —— of my
intention and plan for attacking Ciudad Rodrigo, and him
alone, the success of which depends principally upon the length
of time during which I can keep it concealed from the enemy.
Some Spanish women at Portalegre were apprized of the plan
by him, and it must reach the enemy!!! Yet —— is one of
the best of them.”</p>

<p>Through the correspondence intercepted by the guerillas,
Lord Wellington constantly obtained the most valuable information.
This was generally contained in letters from the
French generals themselves, intended to direct the movements
of their colleagues. Although their despatches were written
in cipher, the Allied leader generally contrived to find out the
key which unveiled their contents; and his own secret espionage
was even more extensive than the enemy’s. “He had
a number of spies amongst the Spaniards who were living
within the French lines; a British officer in disguise constantly
visited the French armies in the field; a Spanish state-counsellor,
living at the head-quarters of the first corps, gave intelligence
from that side; and a guitar-player of celebrity, named
Fuentes, repeatedly making his way to Madrid, brought advice
from thence. Mr. Stuart, under cover of vessels licensed to
fetch corn from France, kept <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasse-marées</i> constantly plying
along the Biscay coast, by which he not only acquired direct
information, but facilitated the transmission of intelligence from
the land spies, amongst whom the most remarkable was a cobbler,
living in a little hutch at the end of the bridge of Irun.
This man, while plying his trade, continued for years, without
being suspected, to count every French soldier that passed in
or out of Spain by that passage, and transmitted their numbers
by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasse-marées</i> to Lisbon.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
But to return to Colonel Jones’s interesting <span class="locked">recollections:—</span></p>

<p>“It appeared that there was a very great difference in the
accuracy of firing by the troops in the trenches. The chief of
the staff, Monsieur Songeon, inquired what description of
troops we had that fired so well. He said, ‘Some days I can
look over the parapets without the slightest molestation; on
other days it is not possible to shew my nose, without the certainty
of being shot.’”</p>

<p>The extensive preparations for opening the Allied fire upon
the place naturally caused much uneasiness to the garrison.</p>

<p>“One morning, a captain of artillery, whom I had never
before seen, came into the ward, and commenced conversing
about the siege, addressing himself particularly to me; he observed
that the whole second parallel was one entire battery;
and if there were as many guns as there were embrasures, he
said, ‘we shall be terribly mauled.’ My reply was, ‘Most
assuredly you will; depend upon it there are as many guns
as embrasures, it is not our fashion to make batteries, and
stick logs of wood into them in the hopes of frightening an
enemy. He made a grimace, and with a shrug of his shoulders
walked out of the ward. The following morning the surgeon
came, as usual, to dress our wounds; this was about half-past
seven; all was still, and he joyously exclaimed, as he entered,
‘So we have another day’s reprieve!’ In about half an hour
afterwards, and whilst I was under his hands, the first salvo
from the breaching batteries was fired; several shots rattled
through the hospital, and disturbed the tranquillity of the inmates;
the instrument dropped from the surgeon’s hands, and
he exclaimed, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le jeu sera bientôt fini!</i> and then very composedly
went on with his work.</p>

<p>“After the breaching batteries had opened their fire, I was
asked by a French officer whether I thought that the prisoners
would remain quiet when an assault of the breach should take
place; and he added, if they were to make any attempts, they
would all be shot. I replied, ‘You may depend upon it that,
if any opportunity offers, they will not be backward in taking
advantage of it; do not fancy you have a flock of sheep penned
within these walls; and happen what may, shoot us or not,
you will be required to give a satisfactory account of us when
the castle is taken.’”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
On the morning of the storm (the 21st of August), the roll
of musketry announced that the trial had begun,—and the
intermediate space of time, until the fall of San Sebastian had
been ascertained, was one of painful solicitude to the prisoners
in the keep.</p>

<p>“From the commencement of the assault, until the rush into
the castle upon the capture of the town, not the slightest information
could we obtain as to the state of affairs at the
breach. The period that intervened was one of the most
anxious and painful suspense: at last the tale was told, and
who can describe the spectacle the interior of the hospital
presented. In an instant the ward was crowded with the
wounded and maimed; the amputation-table again brought
into play; and until nearly daylight the following morning,
the surgeons were unceasingly at work. To have such a scene
passing at the foot of my bed, was sufficiently painful; added
to this, the agonizing shrieks and groans, and the appearance
of the grenadiers and sappers, who had been blown up by the
explosion of the breach—their uniforms nearly burnt off, and
their skins blackened and scorched by gunpowder—was truly
appalling, the recollection of which can never be effaced from
the memories of those whose ill fate compelled them to witness
it. The appearance of these men resembled anything but
human beings: death soon put an end to their sufferings, and
relieved us from these most distressing sights. Of all wounds,
whether of fractured limbs or otherwise, those occasioned by
burns from gunpowder appeared to be accompanied with the
most excruciating pain and constant suffering.”</p>

<p>Nor did the sufferings of the wounded end with their removal
from the breach; for one sad visitation of war followed
fast upon the other.</p>

<p>“After the capture of the town, a heavy bombardment of
the castle took place, by salvos of shells from upwards of sixty
pieces of artillery; the short interval of time which elapsed
between the report of the discharge of the guns and mortars,
and the noise of the descent of the shells, was that of a few
seconds only. The effect of these salvos by day, terrific and
destructive as they proved, was little heeded in comparison
with the nightly discharges. Those of the wounded and mutilated
who were fortunate enough to have found temporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
relief from their sufferings by sleep, were awakened to all the
horrors and misery of their situation by the crash of ten or a
dozen shells falling upon and around the building, and whose
fuzes threw a lurid light into the interior of the ward; the
silence within, unbroken save by the hissing of the burning
composition; the agonizing feelings of the wounded during
these few moments of suspense are not to be described. No
one could feel assured of escaping the destruction which was
a certain attendant upon the explosion, to be immediately
succeeded by the cries and groans of those who were again
wounded.</p>

<p>“Many an unfortunate soldier was brought to the amputation-table
to undergo a second operation; and in the discharge
of this painful duty the medical men were engaged nearly the
entire night. As to rest, none could be obtained or expected
with such scenes passing around a person’s bed. The legs and
arms, as soon as amputated, were carried out, and thrown
away on the rocks. It was a novel, and by no means an
agreeable sight, but one which I was daily compelled to
witness.”</p>

<p>The tremendous effects produced by the British projectiles
are vividly described, and it is hard to decide whether the
shrapnel or common shell was most destructive.</p>

<p>“The effects of the vertical fire in the interior of the castle
immediately after the capture of the town were so destructive
and annoying, that, had it been continued six hours longer, the
garrison, I have no doubt, would have surrendered at discretion.
The officers were loud in their complaints at the obstinacy
of the governor, as they said, in uselessly sacrificing the
lives of the soldiers. They had lost all hope, or nearly so,
that Soult could make any successful attempt for their relief.
During this period everybody sought shelter where best he
could among the rocks; still no nook or corner appeared to be
a protection from the shrapnel-shells. A sergeant of the
Royals, standing at the foot of my bedstead, was killed by a
ball from a shrapnel-shell, and fell dead upon me. An Italian
soldier, who had been appointed to attend upon the wounded
prisoners, whilst endeavouring, close to the hospital door, to
prepare some <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bouillon</i> for our dinner, was, with his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marmite</i>,
blown into the air; and so ended, for the day, all hopes of obtaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
a little nourishment. Life and bustle had disappeared;
scarcely an individual was to be seen moving about.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“The shriek of the bullets from the shrapnel-shell is very
different from the whistle of a musket-ball; and oft repeated
was the exclamation, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah! ces sacrés boulets creux!</i></p>

<p>“It may not be unworthy of remark, that the bullets discharged
from a shrapnel-shell assume the form of a polygonal
prism. A French officer showed me one that had just been
extracted from a wounded man; he anxiously inquired whether
they were of that form when put into the shell. I afterwards
observed the same in many others, which, at my request,
were handed to me by the operating surgeons.</p>

<p>“The excellence of the British artillery is well known.
Nothing could surpass the precision with which the shells
were thrown, and the accuracy with which the fuzes were cut.
It is only those who have had the opportunity of witnessing
their fire, and comparing it with that of the French, that can
speak of its superiority. During the siege, we little heeded
the lazy French shells thrown into the batteries or trenches.
From the length of the fuzes, sufficient time was almost always
allowed, before bursting, to put ourselves under cover;
and, when they did burst, the splinters flew lazily around. On
the contrary, when the sound of an English shell was heard
in the castle, or when the man stationed in the donjon cried,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Garde la bombe</i>, everybody was on the alert. The velocity
of its flight far exceeded that of the French. Touching the
ground and bursting were almost simultaneous; and then
the havoc and destruction caused by the splinters were tremendous.</p>

<p>“None but those who have been exposed to the effects of
shrapnel-shells can fully appreciate the advantages of possessing
such a terrific and destructive missile. It appeared to be
of little avail where a man placed himself for protection. No
place was secure from them; and many a soldier was wounded
without having been aware that any shell had exploded in his
neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>With an episode in which the fair sex are introduced, and
where French gallantry does not appear advantageously, I
shall close my observations on the <span class="locked">sieges—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
“There were,” says Colonel Jones, “three French ladies in
the garrison—the widow and two daughters of a French
commissary-general who had died in Spain: they were on their
way to France when the investment took place. These ladies
were permitted to enter the hospital, and were allowed a small
place at one end of the wooden bedstead, where they remained
for several days and nights; the only water they could obtain
to wash since the island of Santa Clare had been in the
possession of the besiegers, was the same that we had,—sea-water,
which the attendants contrived to procure by descending
the rocks at the back of the castle. The small quantity
of fresh water obtained from the tank during the night
was reserved for cookery or drinking, which was greatly
needed by the troops during the fatigue and heat to which
they were exposed at this very hot season of the year. As
the number of the wounded increased, so the accommodation
in the hospital became more restricted. Some of the officers
who were lying upon the floor were loud in their complaints,
that Madame and her daughters were occupying the space
which properly belonged to them; they succeeded in getting
the ladies turned out to find shelter from shot and shell where
they best could! The day the castle capitulated, I went in
search of my fair companions, and found them nearly smoke-dried,
under a small projecting rock. One of the young ladies
was extremely pretty, and shortly after the siege was married
to the English commissary appointed to attend on the garrison
until they embarked for England. The change from the hospital
to the naked rock, however, relieved them from witnessing
many a painful scene, as the amputating-table was placed
at the bottom of the bedstead in that part of the room allotted
to their use.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">NARRATIVE OF NAPOLEON’S ADVENTURES, FROM HIS ESCAPE
FROM ELBA UNTIL HIS ARRIVAL AT THE TUILLERIES.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Abridged from the <i>Moniteur</i> of the 26th of March, 1815.)</p>

<p>On the 26th of February, at five in the evening, he embarked
on board a brig, carrying 26 guns, with 400 men of his
guard. Three other vessels which happened to be in the port,
and which were seized, received 200 infantry, 100 Polish light
horse, and the battalion of flankers of 200 men. The wind
was south, and appeared favourable; Captain Chaubard was
in hopes that before break of day the isle of Capraia would
be doubled, and that he should be out of the track of the
French and English cruisers who watched the coast. This
hope was disappointed. He had scarcely doubled Cape St.
Andre, in the isle of Elba, when the wind fell, and the sea
became calm; at break of day he had only made six leagues,
and was still between the isle of Capraia and the isle of Elba,
in sight of the cruisers.—The peril appeared imminent; several
of the mariners were for returning to Porto Ferrajo. The
Emperor ordered the voyage to be continued, having for a
resource, in the last resort, to seize the French cruisers. They
consisted of two frigates and a brig, but all that was known
of the attachment of the crews to the national glory would
not admit of a doubt that they would have hoisted the tri-coloured
flag and ranged themselves on our side. Towards
noon the wind freshened a little. At four in the afternoon we
were off the heights of Leghorn; a frigate appeared five
leagues to windward, another was on the coast of Corsica,
and farther off a vessel of war was coming right before the
wind, in the track of the brig. At six o’clock in the evening,
the brig, which had on board the Emperor, met with a brig
which was recognised to be Le Zéphir, commanded by Captain
Andrieux, an officer distinguished as much by his talents as by
his true patriotism. It was proposed to speak the brig, and
cause it to hoist the tri-coloured flag. The Emperor, however,
gave orders to the soldiers of the guard to take off their caps,
and conceal themselves on the deck, preferring to pass the brig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
without being recognised, and reserving to himself the measure
of causing the flag to be changed, if obliged to have
recourse to it. The two brigs passed side by side. The
Lieutenant de Vaisseau Taillade, an officer of the French
marine, was well acquainted with Captain Andrieux, and
from this circumstance was disposed to speak him. He asked
Captain Andrieux if he had any commissions for Genoa;
some pleasantries were exchanged, and the two brigs going
contrary ways, were soon out of sight of each other, without
Captain Andrieux having the least knowledge of who was
on board this frail vessel.</p>

<p>During the night between the 27th and 28th, the wind
continued fresh. At break of day we observed a 74-gun ship,
which seemed to be making for Saint Florent or Sardinia.
We did not fail to perceive that this vessel took no notice of
the brig.</p>

<p>The 28th, at seven in the morning, we discovered the coast
of Noli; at noon, Antibes; at three on the 1st of March we
entered the Gulf of Juan. The Emperor ordered that a
captain of the guard, with twenty-five men, should disembark
before the troops in the brig, to secure the battery on the
coast, if any one was there. This captain took into his head
the idea of causing to be changed the cockade of the battalion
which was at Antibes. He imprudently threw himself into
the place; the officer who commanded for the king caused
the drawbridges to be drawn up, and shut the gates; his
troops took arms, but they respected these old soldiers, and
the cockade which they cherished. The operation, however,
of the captain failed, and his men remained prisoners at
Antibes. At five in the afternoon the disembarkation in the
Gulf of Juan was effected. We established a bivouac on the
seashore until the moon rose.</p>

<p>At eleven at night the Emperor placed himself at the head
of his handful of brave men, to whose fate were attached such
high destinies. He proceeded to Cannes, from thence to
Grasse, and by Saint Vallier; he arrived on the evening of
the 2nd at the village of Cerenon, having advanced twenty
leagues in the course of the first day. The people of Cannes
received the Emperor with sentiments which were the first
presage of the success of the enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
The 3rd the Emperor slept at Bareme; the 4th he dined
at Digue. From Castellane to Digue, and throughout the
department of the Lower Alps, the peasants, informed of the
march of the Emperor, assembled from all sides on the route,
and manifested their sentiments with an energy that left no
longer any doubt. The 5th, General Cambronne, with an
advanced guard of forty grenadiers, seized the bridge and the
fortress of Sisteron. The same day, the Emperor slept at
Gap, with ten men on horseback and forty grenadiers. The
enthusiasm which the presence of the Emperor inspired
amongst the inhabitants of the Lower Alps, the hatred which
they evinced to the noblesse, sufficiently proved what was the
general wish of the province of Dauphine.—At two in the
afternoon of the 6th the Emperor set out from Gap, accompanied
by the whole population of the town. At Saint
Bonnet the inhabitants, seeing the small number of his troop,
had fears, and proposed to the Emperor to sound the tocsin
to assemble the villages, and accompany him <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>:—“No,”
said the Emperor, “your sentiments convince me that
I am not deceived. They are to me a sure guarantee of the
sentiments of my soldiers. Those whom I shall meet will
range themselves on my side; the more there is of them the
more my success will be secured. Remain, therefore, tranquil
at home.”—At Gap were printed several thousand proclamations,
addressed by the Emperor to the army and to the people,
and from the soldiers of the Guards to their comrades. These
proclamations were spread with the rapidity of lightning
throughout Dauphine.</p>

<p>The same day the Emperor came to sleep at Gorp. The
forty men of the advanced guard of General Cambronne went
to sleep at Mure. They fell in with the advanced guard of a
division of 6,000 men, troops of the line, who had come from
Grenoble to arrest their march. General Cambronne wished
to speak with the advanced posts. He was answered that
they were prohibited from communicating with him. This
advanced guard, however, of the division of Grenoble, fell
back three leagues, and took a position between the lakes at
the village of ——.</p>

<p>The Emperor, being informed of this circumstance, went
to the place, and found there a battalion of the 5th of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
line; a company of sappers, a company of miners; in all
from seven to eight hundred men. He sent an officer of
ordnance, the chef d’escadron Roul, to make known to these
troops the intelligence of his arrival; but that officer could
not obtain a hearing, the prohibition being still urged against
having any communication. The Emperor alighted and went
to the right of the battalion, followed by the guard with their
arms reversed. He made himself known, and said that the
first soldier who wished to kill his Emperor might do it: an
unanimous cry of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur</i> was their answer. This
brave regiment had been under the orders of the Emperor
from his first campaign in Italy. The guard and the soldiers
embraced. The soldiers of the 5th immediately tore off their
cockade, and requested, with enthusiasm and tears in their
eyes, the tri-coloured cockade. When they were arranged in
order of battle, the Emperor said to them—“I come with a
handful of brave men, because I reckon on the people and on
you—the throne of the Bourbons is illegitimate, because it has
not been raised by the nation; it is contrary to the national
will, because it is contrary to the interests of our country, and
exists only for the interests of a few families. Ask your
fathers, ask all the inhabitants who arrive here from the
environs, and you will learn from their own mouths the true
situation of affairs; they are menaced with the return of
tithes, of privileges, of feudal rights, and of all the abuses
from which your successes had delivered them. Is it not
true, peasants?”—“Yes, Sire,” answered all of them with
an unanimous cry, “they wish to chain us to the soil—you
come as the angel of the Lord to save us!”</p>

<p>The brave soldiers of the battalion of the 5th demanded to
march the foremost in the division that covered Grenoble.
They commenced their march in the midst of a crowd of
inhabitants, which augmented every moment. Vizille distinguished
itself by its enthusiasm. “It was here that the
Revolution was born,” said these brave people. “It was we
who were the first that ventured to claim the privileges of
men; it is again here that French liberty is resuscitated, and
that France recovers her honour and her independence.”</p>

<p>Fatigued as the Emperor was, he wished to enter Grenoble
the same evening. Between Vizille and Grenoble, the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
adjutant-major of the 7th of the line, came to announce that
Colonel Labedoyere, deeply disgusted with the dishonour
which covered France, and actuated by the noblest sentiments,
had detached himself from the division of Grenoble, and had
come with the regiment, by a forced march, to meet the
Emperor. Half an hour afterwards this brave regiment
doubled the force of the imperial troops. At nine o’clock in
the evening, the Emperor made his entry into the Faubourg
de——.</p>

<p>The troops had re-entered Grenoble, and the gates of the
city were shut. The ramparts which defended the city were
covered by the 3rd regiment of engineers; consisting of 2,000
sappers, all old soldiers covered with honourable wounds;
by the 4th of artillery of the line, the same regiment in
which, twenty-five years before, the Emperor had been a
captain; by the two other battalions of the 5th of the line,
by the 11th of the line, and the faithful hussars of the 4th.—The
national guard and the whole population of Grenoble were
placed in the rear of the garrison, and made all the air ring
with shouts of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur</i>. They opened the gates,
and at ten at night the Emperor entered Grenoble, in the
midst of an army and a people animated by the most lively
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The next day the Emperor was addressed by the municipality
and all the departmental authorities. The military
chiefs and the magistrates were unanimous in their sentiments.
All said that princes imposed by a foreign force were not
legitimate princes, and that they were not bound by any
engagement to princes for whom the nation had no wish. At
two the Emperor reviewed the troops, in the midst of the
population of the whole department, shouting <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">A bas les
Bourbons! A bas les ennemis du peuple! Vive l’Empereur,
et un gouvernement de notre choix.</i> The garrison of
Grenoble immediately afterwards put itself in a forced march
to advance upon Lyons. It is a remark that has not escaped
observers, that every one of these 6,000 men were provided
with a national cockade, and each with an old and used
cockade, for, in discontinuing their tri-coloured cockade, they
had hidden it at the bottom of their knapsacks; not one was
purchased, at least in Grenoble. It is the same, said they in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
passing before the Emperor, it is the same that we wore at
Austerlitz. This, said the others, we had at Marengo.</p>

<p>The 9th the Emperor slept at Bourgoin. The crowd, and
the enthusiasm with it, if possible increased. “We have
expected you a long time,” said these brave people to the
Emperor; “you have at length arrived to deliver France from
the insolence of the noblesse, the pretensions of the priests,
and the shame of a foreign yoke.” From Grenoble to Lyons
the march of the Emperor was nothing but a triumph. The
Emperor, fatigued, was in his carriage, going at a slow pace,
surrounded by a crowd of peasants, singing songs which
expressed to all the noblesse the sentiments of the brave
Dauphinois. “Ah,” said the Emperor, “I find here the
sentiments which for twenty years induced me to greet France
with the name of the Grand Nation; yes, you are still the
Grand Nation, and you shall always be so.”</p>

<p>The Count d’Artois, the Duc d’Orléans, and several
marshals, had arrived at Lyons. Money had been distributed
to the troops, and promises to the officers. They wished to
break down the bridge de la Guillotière and the bridge
Moraud. The Emperor smiled at these ridiculous preparations.
He could have no doubt of the disposition of the
Lyonnois, still less of the disposition of the soldiers. He
gave orders, however, to General Bertrand to assemble the
boats at Misbel, with the intention of passing in the night,
and intercepting the roads of Moulins and of Macon to the
prince who wished to prevent him from passing the Rhone.
At four a reconnaissance of the 4th hussars arrived at la Guillotière,
and were received with shouts of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i>
by the immense population of a faubourg which is still
distinguished by its attachment to the country. The passage
of Misbel was countermanded, and the Emperor advanced at
a gallop upon Lyons, at the head of the troops which were to
have defended it against him. The Count d’Artois had done
everything to secure the troops. He was ignorant that
nothing is possible in France to an agent of a foreign power,
and one who is not on the side of national honour and the
cause of the people. Passing in front of the 13th regiment
of dragoons, he said to a brave soldier covered with scars,
and decorated with three chevrons, “Let us march, comrade;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
shout, therefore, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</i>” “No, monsieur,” replied
this brave dragoon, “no soldier will fight against his father.
I can only answer you by crying <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i>” The
Count d’Artois mounted his carriage and quitted Lyons,
escorted by a single gendarme. At nine o’clock at night the
Emperor traversed the Guillotière almost alone, but surrounded
by an immense population.</p>

<p>The following day, the 11th, he reviewed the whole division
of Lyons, and the brave General Brayer, at their head, put
them in march to advance upon the capital. The sentiments
which the inhabitants of this great city and the peasants of
the vicinity, during the space of two hours, evinced towards
the Emperor, so touched him, that it was impossible for him
to express his feelings otherwise than by saying, “People of
Lyons, I love you.” This was the second time that the
acclamations of this city had been the presage of new destinies
reserved for France.</p>

<p>On the 13th, at three in the afternoon, the Emperor arrived
at Villefranche, a little town of 4,000 souls, which included
at that moment more than 60,000. He stopped at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hôtel
de ville</i>. A great number of wounded soldiers were presented
to him. He entered Macon at seven o’clock in the evening,
always surrounded by the people of the neighbouring districts.
He expressed his astonishment to the natives of Macon at the
slight efforts they made in the last war to defend themselves
against the enemy, and support the honour of Burgundy.—“Sire,
why did you appoint a bad mayor?”</p>

<p>At Tournies the Emperor had only praises to bestow upon
the inhabitants, for their excellent behaviour and patriotism,
which under the same circumstances have distinguished
Tournies, Chalons, and St. Jean-de-Lone. At Chalons,
which during forty days resisted the force of the enemy, and
defended the passage of the Saone, the Emperor took notice of
all the instances of valour; and not being able to visit St. Jean-de-Lone,
he sent the decoration of the Legion of Honour to the
worthy mayor of that city. On that occasion the Emperor
exclaimed, “It is for you, brave people, that I have instituted
the Legion of Honour, and not for emigrants pensioned by
our enemies.”</p>

<p>The Emperor received at Chalons the deputation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
town of Dijon, who came to drive from among them the
prefect and the wicked mayor, who, during the last campaign,
had dishonoured Dijon and its inhabitants. The Emperor
removed this mayor and appointed another, confiding the
command of the division to the brave General Devaux.</p>

<p>On the 15th the Emperor slept at Autun, and from Autun
he went to Avallon, and slept there on the night of the 16th.
He found upon this road the same sentiments as among the
mountains of Dauphiny. He re-established in their office all
the functionaries who had been deprived for having united to
defend their country against foreigners. The inhabitants of
Chiffey had been peculiarly the object of persecution by an
upstart sub-prefect at Semur, for having taken up arms
against the enemies of our country. The Emperor gave
orders to a brigadier of gendarmerie to arrest this sub-prefect,
and to conduct him to the prison of Avallon.</p>

<p>On the 17th, the Emperor breakfasted at Vermanton, and
went to Auxerre, where the prefect remained faithful to his
post. The noble 14th had trampled under foot the white
cockade. The Emperor likewise heard that the 6th regiment
of lancers had likewise mounted the tri-coloured cockade, and
was gone to Montereau to protect that point against a
detachment of the body-guard who wished to pass it. The
young men of this body-guard, unaccustomed to the effects of
lancers, took flight on the first appearance of this corps, which
made two prisoners. At Auxerre, Count Bertrand, major-general,
gave orders to collect all the boats to embark the
army, which was already four divisions strong, and to convey
them the same night to Fossard, so that they would be able
to arrive at one o’clock in the morning at Fontainbleau.
Before he left Auxerre the Emperor was rejoined by the
Prince of Moskwa. This marshal had mounted the tri-coloured
cockade among all the troops under his command.</p>

<p>The Emperor reached Fontainbleau on the 20th, at four
o’clock in the morning. At seven o’clock he learned that the
Bourbons had left Paris, and that the capital was free. He
immediately set off thither, and at nine o’clock at night he
entered the Tuilleries, at the moment when he was least
expected.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">GENERAL FOY’S OBSERVATIONS ON THE CHARACTER AND
COMPOSITION OF THE FRENCH, BRITISH, AND SPANISH
ARMIES.</p></blockquote>

<p>War, considered as a technical science, has made constant
but slow advances, from the first employment of gunpowder
to the revival of the equal step in marching, and to the
improved system of firing of the Prussian armies. It will
now, probably, remain stationary till some capital discovery
shall produce a revolution in the arts. In fact, twenty-four
years of battles fought by the French with nearly the whole
world, have not suggested any alteration in the principal
weapon of the moderns,—the musket provided with the
bayonet; and the science of tactics has not materially
advanced beyond the combinations devised by the great
Frederick.</p>

<p>The Imperial army of France was more scientifically regulated,
more plentifully supplied with money, clothing, arms,
and ammunition, than the armies of the Republic had ever
been.</p>

<p>After the Revolution the general officers of the French
army exchanged the vague denomination of lieutenant-general,
and maréchal de camp, for those of general of division
and general of brigade, as more precise and significant.
Bodies of infantry, consisting of three battalions, were then
called demi-brigades; but Napoleon afterwards restored the
name of regiment, and gave the rank of colonel to its chief.
A regiment usually consisted of three battalions (though in
the Peninsular war they were formed into five battalions of
six companies each), and possessed but one eagle, which
usually accompanied the first battalion. The battalion of
infantry consisted of nine companies, including one of grenadiers.
Napoleon subsequently added a picked company
called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voltigeurs</i>, composed of men of small stature, but intelligent
and active.</p>

<p>These <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voltigeurs</i> constituted the light infantry of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
French armies, and habitually performed the service of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>. An action always commenced with swarms of
tirailleurs on foot and on horseback: this species of fighting
favoured the development of individual faculties, and was
eminently suited to the restless spirit and courage in attack
peculiar to the French. This mode of combat was an innovation
upon the old system of tactics, and foreigners ascribed
the first successes of the French armies to the prodigal use of
light troops. The tirailleurs harassed the enemy, escaped
from his masses by their velocity, and from his artillery by
their dispersion. No army has its flanks wholly impregnable;
there will always be found gaps that favour the assailant—into
these the tirailleurs rushed by inspiration; a weak
point once discovered, all vied in their efforts against it.
The flying artillery—another innovation upon the old school,
dashed up at a gallop, and discharged their pieces in the very
teeth of the enemy. The main army moved in the direction
thus pointed out to it; the infantry in columns; the cavalry
interposed by regiments or in squadrons, ready for every
emergency that the battle might present. To withstand the
shock of French troops thus brought into action, the German
armies, apathetic in the cause for which they were contending,
and commanded by sexagenarian generals, were manifestly
inefficient. It satisfied their ideas of the art of war if
the flanks were turned: or merely passed; their cumbrous
masses, drawn up laboriously in right lines, then quickly
broke. The French foot-soldiers of five feet high brought in
the giants of Germany and Croatia as prisoners by hundreds;
the horse-chasseurs made themselves masters of the enemies’
guns and their ill-appointed trains; and the fugitives owed
their safety to the firmness of their heavy cavalry, which was
at first superior to the French. The regulations for the
infantry manœuvres were constantly varied in their practical
application by the most intelligent commanders, to suit the
exigencies of modern warfare. In this manner was adopted
the practice of facing and fighting with the third rank as well
as the first; movements were also frequently made upon two
ranks to shew that the third is only a reserve intended to
support the other two; the square, which the Arabs had
taught the French to adopt in Egypt, became a fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
formation for infantry. The successive firing by ranks was
found the most suitable to employ against cavalry, from its
not having the defenceless intervals of the battalion fire, and
also from its not interfering so much with the use of the
bayonet.</p>

<p>Cavalry cannot be organized upon the same plan of uniformity
as infantry; it requires different arms, equipments,
and horses, according to the peculiar purposes for which they
are required. Napoleon endeavoured to render the varied
character of the cavalry more distinct. The heavy cavalry
(cuirassiers) was reduced to the number indispensable for its
employment in pitched battles. The dragoons, an amphibious
creation of an age when fire-arms were not brought to perfection,
were nearly disorganized preparatory to the intended
expedition to England: part of them were dismounted; this
change furnished, instead of good cavalry, a small increase
of indifferent and expensive infantry. When afterwards
remounted, they supplied almost exclusively the whole service
of the cavalry in the Peninsular war. During the latter
years of the Imperial Government, several regiments of dragoons
were converted into lancers. Montecuculli calls the
lance, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la reine des armes blanches</i>:” this weapon, from its
reaching farther than any other, is indeed the most formidable
employed by cavalry.</p>

<p>The horse-chasseurs and the hussars, who differ only in
certain modifications of their uniform, were the easiest to
mount, recruit, and train, and were found to be of the most
service in war; Napoleon, accordingly, increased their number.
The cavalry of the line consisted, in 1807, of two regiments
of carabineers, twelve of cuirassiers, thirty of dragoons,
twenty-four of chasseurs, and ten of hussars, making a total
of seventy-eight regiments.</p>

<p>The cavalry retained the monarchical physiognomy longer
than the infantry. The Revolution had not improved their
quality; during the first campaigns they could, therefore,
scarcely cope with the German cuirassiers, the Walloon
dragoons, and the Hungarian hussars. Large bodies of
French cavalry were then seldom employed together, and
when brought into the field in masses were most frequently
worsted. The French are not naturally good horsemen, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
great part of the soil being cultivated with the aid of oxen;
and, from the restless vivacity of the national character, they
find it difficult to identify themselves with the horse.</p>

<p>With these defects, it was to be apprehended that the
cavalry would decline. The contrary happened eventually,
and may be partly accounted for by the facilities that conquest
afforded in furnishing remounts, and in introducing finer
breeds of horses. The horse-soldiers, moreover, sustained less
loss than the infantry, and the old regiments, by means of
provisional augmentation, constantly adding to their force,
acquired an abundance of veteran soldiers. Young men of
family, mostly impatient of the austere discipline of the infantry,
readily furnished active, ardent, and well-mounted horsemen.
The principal cause of the unhoped-for improvement
in the French cavalry, however, must be ascribed to the
system adopted by Napoleon for the conduct of that arm in
war.</p>

<p>It was no sooner better instructed and better mounted than
it became more terrible to its adversaries, and its employment
was not confined, as it used to be, to the completion of the
victory. It entered the lists against unbroken masses of
infantry and cavalry, and its ardour sometimes decided the
fate of battles.</p>

<p>Officers of cavalry, like the Neys and the Richepanses,
were thinly strewed in the armies of the Republic. But at
the head of the Imperial squadrons were seen Murat, Lasalle,
Kellermann, Montbrun, and other men, who excelled in the
art of regulating and directing vast “hurricanes of cavalry.”
The decision so requisite in a commander-in-chief should also
be possessed by the general of cavalry. With a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d’œil</i>,
as rapid as lightning, he must combine the vigour of youth,
a powerful voice, and the agility and address of a centaur.
Above all, it is requisite that he should be prodigally endowed
with that precious faculty which no other can replace, and
which is more rare than is generally supposed,—unflinching
bravery.</p>

<p>The French artillery, previously to the Revolution, had
the reputation of being the first in Europe. It was in the
regiment of La Fère, the first of that arm, that Buonaparte
commenced his military career. The artillery participated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
the enthusiasm of the Revolution, but its discipline scarcely
suffered. It took an active part in the defence of the country,
and in the offensive movements of the armies in 1792
and 1793. At that time great numbers of cannon were
employed in battle. The four-pounders were attached to
battalions of infantry; the howitzers, the eight, the twelve,
and even the sixteen-pounders, particularly appropriated to
sieges, then formed batteries of six to twelve guns, called batteries
of position. An improvement suited to French impetuosity
had recently been borrowed from the Prussians, for
the field-service. It consisted in mounting on horseback a
certain number of gunners, who, by that means, arrived on
the ground as quickly as the best-horsed pieces, were always
at hand to work them, and could readily avoid being attacked.
This kind of artillery kept up the cannonade longer and
closer. The horse artillery was composed, on its first formation,
of the nimblest artillery-men, and was afterwards
recruited with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of the grenadiers, and performed prodigies
of valour and service. In the campaigns in Germany,
mere captains of that arm were seen to acquire the reputation
of generals. It was not long before the generals would not
have any other artillery, as from being more moveable and
more efficient, less of it was required, and the columns of the
train were lightened in proportion.</p>

<p>It was frequently proposed to Napoleon to unite the artillery
and the engineers; he had not the imprudence to try the
experiment, but he collected the pupils of both arms in an
institution, to which the Polytechnic School served as a
nursery. This school, after having been a focus of light to
France and Europe, was re-constructed on a narrower and
less liberal plan. The profession of arms took the preference
of all others in the mind of Napoleon. He transformed a
nursery of savans into a seminary for warriors.</p>

<p>In the rear of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> of Napoleon marched a
reserve, which never had its equal. The Imperial Guard
represented the glory of the army, and the majesty of the
empire. Its officers and men were selected from among those
whom the brave had designated as the bravest; all of them
were covered with scars. Bred amid dangers, they had lived
much in a few years; and the name of <span class="smcap">The Old Guard</span> was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
appropriately given to a corps, the oldest members of which
had not reached the age of forty. Though loaded with favours
by the Emperor, yet their recompense was always inferior to
their service. Carried to fields of battle on foot by forced
marches, in boats, or in carriages, the news of their arrival on
the scene of action always struck terror into the hearts of their
enemies. By successive augmentations the Emperor raised
the effective of his guard to sixty-eight battalions, thirty-one
squadrons, and eighty pieces of artillery. In the days of his
prosperity he employed it only in detached portions; fifteen
years it remained standing amidst the vicissitudes of the
empire, solid as a <em>pillar of granite</em>. One day it succumbed:
on the tombs of these heroes our descendants will inscribe these
words, which were uttered during the heat of that fatal conflict:—“The
Guards may perish, but will never surrender!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The English were looked upon by the French as sea-wolves,
unskilful, perplexed, and powerless, the moment they set their
foot on land. If their national pride appealed to the victories
of Cressy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, they were reminded
that the armies of Edward III. and of Henry V. were composed
of Normans, of the people of Poitou, and of Gascons.
There were, for all that, among the conquerors, a goodly number
of native Englishmen, and certainly, the blows which they
dealt were not the weakest. The Black Prince and Talbot were
born in Albion. Nearer our own times, Marlborough and his
twelve thousand soldiers were not the least formidable enemies
of Louis XIV. The celebrated column of British infantry at
Fontenoy had suggested to a second Bossuet the image of a
tower repairing its own breaches.</p>

<p>Even since the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i> of French glory had thrown into shade
both ancient and modern history, there had been remarked in
the British troops employed in Flanders, and in Holland,
though feebly commanded, repeated instances of vigour and
audacity. The French soldiers, who had returned from Egypt,
talked to their comrades of the indomitable valour of the
English; moreover, it was easy to suppose that enterprise,
capacity, and courage render the possessors fit for other purposes
than the duties of the sea service. Their skill and intrepidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
in braving the dangers of the ocean have always been
unrivalled. Their restless disposition, and fondness for travelling
fit them for the wandering life of the soldier; and they
possess that most valuable of all qualities in the field of battle—coolness
in their strife.</p>

<p>The glory of the British army is based principally upon its
excellent discipline, and upon the cool and sturdy courage of
the people. Indeed we know of no other troops so well disciplined.
The principal cause of their pre-eminence in this
respect, would, if applied to the French army, most likely produce
an effect diametrically opposite. Varieties of character
and condition, require the employment of different means to
obtain the same end.</p>

<p>The English non-commissioned officers are excellent; but
their courage and their talent are not encouraged by promotion
to higher grades. They are nominated by the commander of
the regiment, and cannot be broke but by the sentence of a
court-martial. Their authority is extensive, comprehending
the minute details of inspection, of discipline, and of daily
instruction,—duties which, in other armies, would not be committed
to them.</p>

<p>In the British army will not be found either the strong
sympathy between the leaders and the soldiers, the paternal
care of the captains, the simple manners of the subalterns, nor
the affectionate fellow-feeling in danger and suffering which
constituted the strength of the revolutionary armies of France;
but unshaken patriotism, and tried and steady bravery, are to
be met with everywhere amongst them.</p>

<p>The infantry, when in active service, is distributed into
brigades of two, three, and even four regiments, according to
the number and strength of the battalions. The grenadiers are
not distinguished among the other soldiers for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i> and
pre-eminence so striking in the French and Hungarian grenadiers;
and it is not customary to unite them into separate
corps, in order to attempt bold strokes. The light companies
of different regiments are sometimes formed into provisional
battalions,—a practice directly in opposition to the purpose for
which that species of troops was originally instituted.</p>

<p>Several regiments of the line, such as the forty-third, the
fifty-first, the fifty-second &amp;c., are called <em>light infantry regiments</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
These corps, as well as the light companies of the
battalions, have nothing light about them but the name; for
they are armed, and, with the exception of some slight change
in the decorations, clothed like the rest of the infantry. It
was considered that the English soldier did not possess sufficient
intelligence and address to combine with the regular duty
of the line the service of inspiration of the sharp-shooter.
When the necessity of a special light infantry began to be felt,
the best marksmen of different corps were at first selected;
but it was afterwards found expedient to devote exclusively
to the office of sharpshooters the eight battalions of the sixtieth,
the three of the ninety-fifth, and some of the foreign
corps. These troops are armed with the rifle. During the
last war, companies of these riflemen were always attached to
the different brigades. The echoing sound of their horns
answered the twofold purpose, of directing their own movements,
and of communicating such manœuvres of the enemy as
would otherwise be unobserved by the general in command.</p>

<p>The English, the Scotch, and the Irish are usually mixed
together in the regiments. Ireland supplies more soldiers, in
proportion to its population, than the other two kingdoms. It
might be supposed that the general character which we have
attributed to the English troops would be altered by this
mixture; but the English discipline is like the bed of Procrustes
to all who come within its sphere,—the minds as well as the
bodies of their fellow-subjects obey their law as the ruling
people. Four Highland regiments, consisting of nine battalions,
are, however, recruited almost exclusively from the
mountains of Scotland, and their officers are selected in preference
from natives of that country. The Highlanders wear
their national <em>kilt</em> instead of smallclothes; this neither harmonizes
with the rest of their dress nor is it convenient for war;
but this is of little moment compared with the moral advantages
gained by adopting the national costume; a distinction
which has its source in popular feeling and custom, generally
imposes the performance of additional duty: there are no
troops in the British service more steady in battle than the
Scotch regiments.</p>

<p>The infantry is the best portion of the British army. It is
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">robur peditum</i>,—the expression applied by the Romans to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">triarii</i> of their legions. The English do not scale mountains,
or scour the plain, with the suppleness and rapidity of
the French; but they are more silent, more orderly, and more
obedient, and for these reasons their fire is better directed, and
more destructive. Though not so resigned under a heavy fire
as the Russians, they draw together with less confusion, and
preserve their original formation better. Their composition
exhibits something of the German mechanism, combined with
more activity and energy. The system of manœuvres which
they have adopted since the year 1798, is borrowed from the
Prussians. The infantry, although on system formed three
deep, like the other armies of Europe, is more frequently
drawn up in two ranks; but when making or receiving a charge,
it is frequently formed four deep. Sometimes it has made
offensive movements, and even charged columns, when in open
order. In a retreat it stands firm, and commences its fire by
volleys from the battalions, followed by a well-supported file-firing.
It turns round coolly to check the enemy hanging on
its rear; and while marching, it fires without separating.</p>

<p>The English infantry does not hesitate to charge with the
bayonet; the leader, however, who would wish to employ
British infantry to advantage, should move it seldom and cautiously,
and reckon more upon its fire than upon its manœuvres.</p>

<p>The pains bestowed by the English on their horses, and the
superior qualities of their native breeds, at first gave a more
favourable idea of their cavalry than the experience of war
has justified. The horses are badly trained for fighting. They
have narrow shoulders and a hard mouth, and neither know
how to turn or to halt. Cropping their tails is a serious inconvenience
in hot climates. The luxurious attentions which
are lavished upon them, render them quite unfit to support
fatigue, scarcity of food, or the exposure of the bivouac. The
men are, however, excellent grooms.</p>

<p>The heaviest English cavalry is far from possessing the
uniformity and the firm seat of the French and Austrian cuirassiers;
and their light-horse is still more inferior in intelligence
and activity to the Hungarian hussar and the Cossack.
They have no idea of the artifices of partisan warfare, and
they know as little how to charge <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>. When the fray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
commences, you see them equally vulnerable and offensive,
cutting instead of thrusting, and chopping with more fury than
effect at the faces of their enemies.</p>

<p>During the war in the Peninsula, the French soldiers were
so struck with the elegant dresses of the light dragoons, their
shining helmets, and the graceful shapes of the men and horses,
that they gave them the name of <em>Lindors</em>. In 1813, this dress,
which was peculiar to the British troops, was exchanged for
the head-dress and jacket of the German light cavalry. The
Polish lances at Albuera, and the French cuirasses at Waterloo,
have induced the English to add these modes of arming and
equipment to their cavalry.</p>

<p>In cavalry service it is not sufficient for the soldiers to be
brave, and the horses good; there must also be science and
unity. More than once, in the Peninsular war, weak detachments
of British cavalry have charged French battalions
through and through, but in disorder; the squadrons could
not be again re-formed; there were no others at hand to finish
the work; thus the bold stroke passed away, without producing
any advantage.</p>

<p>The artillery holds the first rank in the army; it is better
paid, its recruits are more carefully selected, and its period of
enlistment is limited to twelve years. The gunners are distinguished
from other soldiers by their excellent spirit. In
battle they display judicious activity, a perfect <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d’œil</i>,
and stoical bravery.</p>

<p>The English got the start of the French in the formation of
the artillery-train: the first trials of it were made in 1793,
under the auspices of the Duke of Richmond, then Master-general
of the Ordnance. The corps of <em>Royal Artillery
Drivers</em> is organized as soldiers. Very high prices are paid
for the horses employed to draw the guns, and they are, consequently,
extremely good. The harness is as good as that
used in French carriages. No nation can rival the English
in the equipments and the speed of their conveyances.</p>

<p>English troops take few pieces into the field with them;
the most that Lord Wellington ever had in the Peninsula,
barely amounted to two for every thousand men. Frames,
caissons, barrels, and bullets, powder, and every part of the
equipage, are remarkable for the goodness of the materials, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
well as excellent workmanship. In battles, the artillery made
most copious and effective use of a kind of hollow bullet,
called <em>Shrapnell’s spherical case-shot</em>, from the name of the
inventor.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be said, that the English army surpasses
other armies in discipline, and in some particulars of
internal management; it proceeds slowly in the career of improvement,
but it never retrogrades; and no limits can be
affixed to the power of organization to which a free and
intelligent people may attain.</p>

<p>The military profession is quite in accordance with the contemplative
character and innate indolence of the Spaniards;
yet they manifested an extreme repugnance to military service,
and especially to that of the infantry. Voluntary enlistment
was almost entirely confined to the towns, and was
supplied from the vicious and reckless portion of society. A
long peace, the insulated position of the country, and the
lethargy of the Government, had almost extinguished the old
warlike spirit of Spain. While the din of arms resounded
throughout the rest of Europe, even the shadow of war was
rarely to be seen in Spain. The sovereign never appeared in
the garb of a soldier; the nobility had forgotten at what price
their grandeur and titles had been purchased by their ancestors;
arms had scarcely the dignity of a profession. There
were no camps for the performance of manœuvres, none of
those large garrisons, in which regiments learn to know each
other and to act together. In the neglected state of the
Spanish army, even the sacredness of the point of honour had
fallen into a state of relaxation.</p>

<p>Nature has endowed the Spaniard with most of the qualities
required to form a good soldier. He is religious, calm,
and attached to order and justice, he is naturally disposed to
subordination, and is capable of great devotion to an able
leader. His patience is inexhaustible, he is always sober, and
so temperate that he can live upon a pilchard, or a bit of
bread rubbed with garlic; a bed is a superfluity to him, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
is accustomed to sleep in the open air. Next to the French,
the Spaniards are the best for long marches, and climbing
mountains. The Spanish soldier is less intelligent than the
French, but more so than the German and English soldier.
He ardently loves his country, and has but one anti-military
fault, a disregard of cleanliness, and indolent habits,—a frequent
source of disease and inefficiency. The Spanish army was
deficient in discipline; its non-commissioned officers were but
little respected; one-third of the officers were taken from
among them: the remaining two-thirds were filled up from
the cadets.</p>

<p>The Spanish infantry consisted of thirty-nine regiments, of
three battalions each, including four foreign regiments.
Several of these corps were established prior to the accession
of the Bourbons; some of them were even raised by Charles
V.; the oldest of all bore the name of Immemorial del Rey,
from the remote antiquity of its creation. Twelve battalions
of light infantry, armed like the infantry of the line, differed
from it only in the colour of the jacket, which was blue, while
that of the national infantry was white. Most of these battalions
were raised subsequently to the French Revolution.
Each regiment of infantry of the line had a colonel, a
lieutenant-colonel, a commandant, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel,
and a major (<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">sarjento-mayor</i>). Each battalion of
light infantry had only two superior officers, a commandant,
and a major. The battalions of the line were of four companies,
two companies of the first battalion being grenadiers.</p>

<p>In war time, forty-two regiments of militia formed a body
of infantry, more national, more brave, more calculated for
great things than the regular infantry. The State armed,
clothed, and equipped them, and allowed pay to the officers.
In time of peace they were called out only for one month in
the year, when they received pay. These militia regiments
consisted of only one battalion, commanded by a colonel,—a
man of consideration in the country, and a major—generally
a superior officer of the regular army. There were but two
companies in the battalion, one of grenadiers, and one of
chasseurs. In war time, the companies of grenadiers and of
chasseurs of the same province, were united. In this manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
were formed the four divisions of provincial grenadiers of old
and new Castile, Andalusia, and Galicia—the best soldiers in
the nation, preferable even to the household regiments.
History has consecrated the plains of Rocroi as the grave of
the Spanish infantry.</p>

<p>The cavalry preserved its ancient renown till the close of
the war of the Succession; it has lost it since then. Spain,
which in the time of Charles V. could supply a hundred
thousand horses for war, now has breeding establishments in
only one of her provinces. The Andalusian horses, though
mettlesome, docile, and finely-formed, have something of the
rodomontade of that province, which is the Gascony of Spain.
They want the bottom, and the muscular power which are
requisite for the charging shock of heavy cavalry, and have
not the robustness and capacity for enduring fatigue, which is
necessary for the light cavalry service. The multiplication of
mules has probably caused the degeneracy of the Spanish
horses.</p>

<p>The whole cavalry of Spain amounted to twelve thousand
men, in twenty-four regiments, each of five squadrons, which
were never complete. Each regiment is commanded by a
colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, and a major. The cavalry was
composed of dragoons, chasseurs, and hussars; but distinguished
from each other rather by the colour of their uniform
than by the mode in which they were armed and equipped.
The carabineers, which formed part of the King’s household,
consisted of six squadrons, four of heavy, and two of light
horse, and numbered about six hundred men. They were
recruited from the whole of the cavalry, among the old
soldiers, and those of the best character; they enlisted for
life, and renounced marriage: this was the finest body of
horse in Spain. The Spanish cavalry was badly trained, and
was very inferior to the infantry.</p>

<p>Philip V. employed La Valliere, the most distinguished
French officer of artillery of his time, to organize the Spanish
artillery on the same footing as that of Louis XIV. It
has since followed the changes and improvements adopted
by the French. Its force consisted of four regiments, of ten
companies each; out of these forty companies, six were of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
horse artillery. Besides these, there were sixty-four companies
of militia cannoneers without officers or serjeants,
being merely supplementary to the regular artillery. There
was no artillery train organized in a military manner; in
time of war, it was supplied by contracts with the muleteers,
or by requisitions of oxen. Godoy organized the engineer
corps in 1803, on a similar plan to the artillery, based upon
the regulations of the French service, and instituted a school
of engineering at Alcala de Henares.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> At the commencement of the siege the garrison numbered twenty
thousand men of all arms, and more than two hundred and fifty pieces of
cannon were mounted on the works. Indeed, Tippoo’s arsenal was amply
stocked with artillery—for more than six hundred pieces, in all the variety
of Indian calibre, fell into the hands of the English after the capture of
the place.</p></div>

which the besiegers had been greatly annoyed by a constant discharge of
musketry, a curious incident occurred while returning in the dark to the
lines. Lieutenant Lambton came up, and assured the general to whose
staff he was attached, that the troops, instead of marching <em>from</em>, were
marching <em>on</em> the enemy. The guide, on being referred to, was obstinate
in asserting that he was right, while Lambton declared that in the starlight
he had clearly ascertained that instead of moving to the southward,
the troops were marching directly <em>north</em>. Baird procured a pocket-compass—and,
putting a fire-fly on the glass, ascertained that his march was
erroneous, and his guide entirely astray. Fortunately, he had time to
remedy the mistake—jocularly observing, that “in future he should put
more faith in the stars than he had done formerly”—<i>Hook</i>.</p></div>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> On the 24th July, 1780, the cavalry of Hyder Aly, being within nine
miles of Madras, a despatch was sent off to Colonel Bailey, who was in
the Northern Circar, with a force of about three or four thousand men, to
join Sir Hector Munro’s army at the mount at Madras. Most unfortunately,
however, this order was subsequently changed, and Colonel
Bailey was directed to proceed direct to Conjeverone. On his way to join
Sir Hector Munro, he fell in with a detachment of Hyder’s army, under
the command of his son Tippoo, consisting of thirty thousand cavalry,
eight thousand foot, and twelve pieces of cannon. Notwithstanding the
vast numerical superiority of this force over that of Colonel Bailey, considerably
weakened by a mutiny in the first regiment of cavalry, which it
had been found necessary to march prisoners to Madras, they were most
decisively repulsed. This victory, splendid as was the achievement, was
dearly bought; since, by again diminishing the effective strength of this
little army, he considerably added to the dangers and difficulties of his
situation. At this juncture Colonel Bailey sent off a messenger to Sir
Hector Munro, informing him of the precarious state in which he found
himself. In consequence, a detachment was sent to Bailey’s assistance,
under the command of Colonel Fletcher, consisting of the flank companies
of the 73rd, two of European grenadiers, and eleven of sepoys, making
altogether about a thousand men. Dreading an attack, Colonel Fletcher
avoided it by altering his line of march, and making a wide detour, which,
although it added to their fatigue, insured their safety, and enabled them
to join Colonel Bailey on the morning of the 9th, having, nevertheless,
fallen in with Hyder’s pickets close to his position at Perambaukum. The
troops of this detachment, wearied as they were, were permitted to halt
only till the evening, when the whole force marched under the command
of Colonel Bailey to join Sir Hector Munro. Hyder had again obtained
the most correct intelligence of their movements, and taking advantage of
the necessary delay in the return of this gallant body of troops, enfiladed
every part of the road by which they were to march with artillery, and
placed his best infantry in ambuscade at every available point. The English
troops had not proceeded more than four miles, when an alarm was
given that the enemy was on their flank. They immediately formed, but
finding the attack was not serious, continued their march. The road lay
through an avenue of banyan trees, with a jungle on either side, and upon
their entrance into this road they were again attacked on their flanks by
the enemy’s opening two or three guns, and commencing a fire of some
musketry from the thick part of the jungle. They instantly halted, and
immediately afterwards endeavoured to take the guns, but the darkness
frustrated their efforts. And then it was that Colonel Bailey determined
to halt till daylight; a determination at first sight incompatible with the
admitted necessity of making the march by night, and which, while it not
only afforded an opportunity to the enemy to draw off his cannon to
another and stronger point, which the English had inevitably to pass in
the morning, practically announced to Tippoo the exact position in which
he had checked them, and moreover suggested to Hyder the importance
of advancing, in order to take advantage of their unexpected halt. Colonel
Bailey’s words, explanatory of his decision, which he addressed to Captain
Baird, were, “I am determined to halt till daylight, that I may have an
opportunity of seeing about me.” At daylight they accordingly recommenced
their march, and as the column moved out of the avenue into the
plain, a battery of eight guns opened upon it, supported by a strong body
of cavalry and infantry. Bailey immediately ordered Captains Kennedy
and Gowdie, with the native grenadiers, to attack them; they did so, and
succeeded in taking most of the guns, and in driving back the troops who
supported them. But at this moment the heads of the different columns
of Hyder’s army appeared—Hyder having passed Sir Hector Munro in
the night—moving down upon the line, which induced Kennedy and
Gowdie immediately to call off their detachment from the captured guns
to join the main body. At this juncture Bailey formed his force, consisting
of little more than three thousand men, in line upon the bank of an
old nullah, or watercourse, and opened his guns upon the enemy; but
Hyder, too powerful an antagonist for a mere handful of men, so disposed
his immense army as completely to surround him, and commenced a destructive
fire upon him from his artillery in every direction. The various
descriptions of this memorable and most unequal contest all agree in confirming
the belief, that vast as was the disparity between the contending armies,
and although Hyder had upwards of seventy pieces of cannon in the field,
the day would have been won by the English if the fortune of war had not
been so decidedly against them. The enemy were repeatedly and continually
repulsed, their infantry gave way, while their cavalry were falling
in all directions, and it is said, Hyder was only prevented from retreating
by the persuasions of Colonel Lally, who represented to him that retiring
would bring him in contact with Sir Hector Munro, who was in his rear;
and at this moment, and while the English were actually sustaining the
combined attack of Hyder and his son Tippoo, two of their tumbrils
exploded, and in an instant the brave men, who were on the eve of gaining
one of the most splendid victories ever achieved, were deprived of their
ammunition and the services of all their artillery. In this helpless and
dreadful state, under a heavy and tremendous fire of cannon and rockets,
these gallant, but unfortunate soldiers, remained from half-past seven
until nine o’clock. The slaughter of the British began to be tremendous,
as the enemy closed in upon them on every side. Colonel Fletcher had
carried off the grenadier company of the 73rd to support the rear-guard,
and was never heard of more. Hyder Aly came with his whole army on
their right flank, charging them with columns of horse, while the infantry
kept up a heavy fire of musketry. These were followed by the elephants
and Mysore cavalry, which completed the overthrow of the gallant band
of heroes. In the midst of this, Colonel Bailey, wounded as he was,
formed his men into a square, and without ammunition received and repulsed
thirteen different attacks of the enemy’s squadrons. At length the
case became evidently hopeless, and the sepoys, under Captain Lucas,
having been broken and dispersed, Colonel Bailey, seeing that further
resistance was vain, tied his handkerchief on his sword as a flag of truce,
and ordered Captain Baird, who was now second in command, to cease
firing. Hyder’s officers refused to attend to Colonel Bailey’s signal,
pointing to the sepoys, who in their confusion were still continuing to
fire; this, however, being explained, they agreed to give quarter, and
Colonel Bailey directed Captain Baird to order his men to ground their
arms. The order was of course obeyed, and the instant it was so, the
enemy’s cavalry, commanded by Tippoo Saib in person, rushed upon the
unarmed troops before they could recover themselves, cutting down
every man within their reach.—<i>Abridged from Hook’s “Life of Baird.</i>”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> “During this period, Hyder sent some of his principal officers to
induce the English to enter his service. He offered them three times as
much pay as they received in our army, and as many horses, palanquins,
and wives as they chose.”—<i>Life of Sir David Baird.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> He ordered his personal servants to load the carbines which they carried
for his own use, and hastened along the ramparts towards the breach.
He repeatedly fired; and one of his servants saw him bring down several
Europeans near the top of the breach.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> A number of the garrison escaped by uniting their turbans, and
lowering themselves from the bastions. This precarious means of escape
occasionally failed, and many were found at the base of the walls, maimed
or killed from the attempt.</p></div>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> When the Sultaun left the palace he was dressed in a light-coloured
jacket, wide trousers of fine flowered silk, a sash of dark-red silky stuff,
and a turban with one or two distinguishing ornaments. He wore his
sword in a rich belt slung over his shoulder, and a small cartridge-box
hung to another embroidered belt thrown over his left shoulder; the talisman
was fastened under his jacket on his right arm.</p></div>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> It is a curious circumstance, that the expression of the features after
death, when inspected on a field of battle, will generally tell the means by
which life was extinguished. From sword and bayonet wounds, the features
present a calm appearance; while those of persons who have perished
by musketry or cannon-shot are always distorted and convulsed.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The ruler of Mysore was of low stature, corpulent, with high
shoulders, and a short thick neck; but his feet and hands were remarkably
small. His complexion was rather dark, his eyes large and prominent,
with small arched eyebrows, and an aquiline nose. He had an
appearance of dignity, or rather sternness, in his countenance, which distinguished
him above the common order of his people. When examined
after death, he had four wounds—three in the body, and one in the temple;
the ball having entered a little above the right ear, and lodging in
the cheek.—<i>Narrative by Major Allen.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Sleep after a battle is most welcome; but Baird and his staff were
speedily disturbed, and it was communicated to the general that the city
was on fire, and outrages were being committed, which he took immediate
means to remedy. Having again composed himself to rest, a new alarm
disturbed him. “The treasury of Tippoo had been forced, and the soldiers
were actually loading themselves with gold.”

It was true. The door generally used was securely guarded; but
another had been discovered, and by that the plunderers had obtained
access to the treasure. Colonel Wallace found the place crowded with soldiers
and one <em>officer</em>, all busily employed in pocketing gold and jewel.
The individual who disgraced his rank is dead; and Baird, as it is supposed,
out of respect to his family, kept his name a secret.</p></div>

Alexandria. Pursuit was unavailing; she reached the harbour, and hoisting
French colours, proved unequivocally her nation. It will scarcely be
credited that a French frigate, finding herself unexpectedly in the midst of
an English fleet, should have been so capable directly to disguise herself,
as to continue unsuspected on her course with it, which she did the whole
day before, answering the various signals made, and yet never attracted
the smallest suspicion; nevertheless it is a fact, and must remain on record
as an honourable anecdote to the credit of the French captain of the

of shot fired from a practicable elevation and that fired from a field-piece
on a dead level. It is well known to military men, that artillery, firing
from an elevated situation on bodies of troops, is less destructive than
when firing on nearly the same level. In the former case, the shot can
hardly hit more than one or two men; whereas it has been ascertained,
that one single horizontal or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rezant</i> shot has killed <em>forty-two</em> when formed

under the most terrible and destructive fire from the enemy’s guns to
which troops were ever exposed.” This is Sir Robert Wilson’s statement.
Surely, were it necessary to reconnoitre, the troops should have
been sheltered from a fire to which, without any possible object, they
were uselessly exposed. The truth is, the Peninsular campaign first
taught England the art of modern war—and made her army, at its termination,

was a fatal movement which brought it so entirely within cannon-shot of
the second position, and where it was halted so long. If, instead of finally
abandoning so important an object, part of the army had been marched to
the left, obliquely over the ground which lay between Lake Maadie and
Lake Mariotes, subsequently inundated, and then formed to the right,
when the left reached the turn of Pompey’s Pillar, then attacking the south
front of the position, whilst the right of the eastern front was attacked at
the same time, no doubt can now exist of its having been easily carried
and most probably the town of Alexandria. Old and new forts Cretin and
Caffarelli could have opposed but little resistance; and if they had held
out, must have surrendered long before the arrival of General Menou.”—<i>Wilson.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Manhes, steadfast in his purpose, and closing his ears to pity, became,
by the severity of his measures and the novelty of his punishments, the
terror of the Calabrese. He was never known to relax from love of gain;
and it is but just towards his character to state, that individual interests
were never considered in his proscriptions. Faithful to the views of
Murat, he accomplished by persevering activity in less than six months
what others had only begun in six years.
</p>
<p>
Manhes, after having ascertained, commune by commune, the number
of wandering brigands, suspended all labour throughout the country. The
workmen and their cattle were collected in the villages under protection
of the regular troops, and the punishment of death was decreed against
any individual found in the country with provisions, unless belonging to
the armed columns.
</p>
<p>
The principal possessors of property received orders to arm and march
against the brigands, and were made answerable, number for number, and
head for head, not to return to their homes without bringing with them,
dead or alive, the brigands of their respective communes.
</p>
<p>
Pursued by famine and the bayonets of their enemies, the greater number
of the fugitives sold their lives dearly. The remainder of these unfortunate
creatures, reduced to the last extremity, preferred a certain but
immediate death, to the sharp and protracted sufferings of fear and famine.
A prodigious number of them were shot. The heads and limbs of the
condemned were, after their execution, fixed on pikes, and the road from
Reggio to Naples was garnished with these disgusting trophies.
</p>
<p>
The river Crati, upon the banks of which a crowd of these victims was
executed, and which is very shallow at Cozenza, presented for a long time
the disgusting spectacle of their mutilated bodies.
</p>
<p>
The following anecdotes show the determined spirit that animated the
leaders of the band.
</p>
<p>
“Parafanti could not be secured till dead with a hundred wounds.
Perched on the ledge of a rock, which afforded him a certain degree of
protection, his thighs fractured but his arms free, he sacrificed many to
his vengeance. Not one of his discharges failed of effect. His head was
exposed at Rogliano, his birth-place.
</p>
<p>
“Another, who had taken refuge in a mill, set it on fire himself, with
his last cartridge, to prevent his being taken alive.
</p>
<p>
“Nierello was assassinated on the road of Nicastro by one of the civic
guard, who pretended to surrender himself to him.
</p>
<p>
“Paonese, the terror of the environs of Gasparena and of Montanio,
fell a sacrifice to the columns of Manhes—and Masotta, Mescio, Giacinto,
and Antonio, with many others, shared the same fate.
</p>
<p>
“Murat was not, like his predecessor, lavish of amnesties; nevertheless,
he authorized some; and it was observed that the brigand chiefs who took
advantage of them became the most formidable and bitter persecutors of
those in whose dangers and whose crimes they had participated.
</p>
<p>
“Benincasa, chief of the band of St. Braggio, fleeing with four companions
from a French detachment, was stopped by the swelling of the
river Angitola; they tried to effect their passage on a bullock-car, which,
however, was stopped in the middle of the current. To a summons to
surrender, they only returned discharges of their muskets. At last, after
a long and desperate resistance, being all wounded, and having expended
their ammunition, they mutually assisted each other in falling into the
river, where their mangled bodies were afterwards found.
</p>
<p>
“A brigand chief, of the band of Foggia, was condemned to have his
wrist severed. The executioner having failed in the first blow, the sufferer
begged to be permitted to do it himself. He coolly cut off his hand at
one blow, and turning to the executioner, said, ‘Endeavour to learn your
trade better.’”—<i>Memoir of Stuart’s Campaign in Calabria.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> It is scarcely conceivable how much the effect of artillery depends on
the position of the guns, and the accuracy with which they are pointed.
One gun, well placed and skilfully served, has been known to do more
execution than one hundred when laid in an unfavourable situation. This
was most strikingly illustrated in an attack made by Sir Sydney Smith on
a martello tower, armed with two heavy guns, and situated on the extremity
of Cape Licosa.
</p>
<p>
The Pompée, of eighty guns, and two frigates, anchored within eight
hundred yards of the battery, and opened their broadsides. Their fire
was kept up with unremitting fury, until their ammunition failed, and
many of the guns had become unserviceable. The battery returned the
fire slowly—but every shot took effect. The Pompée was the only object
of its fire, and she was at last completely crippled, and obliged to haul
off with the loss of her mizen-top-mast, and nearly forty men killed and
wounded. Almost every shot had hulled her—while the concentrated fire
from three men-of-war had failed entirely in silencing the French cannonnade.
</p>
<p>
On the tower being afterwards surrendered, it appeared that the carriage
of one of the guns had been disabled by the second shot, and subsequently
that it had been fired as it lay on the sill of the embrasure,—so
that, in point of fact, the batteries of the Pompée and her consorts
had been unable to overpower <em>the fire of a single gun</em>, and the opposition
of a garrison, consisting of one officer and twenty-five soldiers.</p></div>

people to their fate. Some of these poor fellows who had thought better
of it, and were endeavouring to overtake their countrymen, were unmercifully
sabred by the French cavalry, many of them in a defenceless state.

“One of the handsomest men in the grenadier company, of the name
of M’Gee, was coming along the road lame from an accident, his firelock
and pack having been taken by his messmates to enable him to keep up;
he was, however, overtaken by two French dragoons, and, although unarmed
and helpless, was inhumanly cut to pieces almost within sight.”—<i>Cadell.</i></p></div>

should be thrown down the mountain; most judiciously considering, that
if the casks were broken the men would make a rush for the money, which
would have caused great confusion, and might have cost the lives of many.
The rear-guard, therefore, was halted; Lieutenant Bennet, of the light
company 28th regiment, was placed over the money, with strict orders
from Sir John Moore to shoot the first person who attempted to touch it.
It was then rolled over the precipice, the casks were soon broken by the
rugged rocks, and the dollars falling out, rolled over the height a sparkling
cascade of silver. The French advanced guard coming up shortly after
to the spot, were detained for a time picking up a few dollars that had
been scattered on the road.”—<i>Cadell.</i></p></div>

circulated over the continent grossly exaggerated the real loss of our army,
and heavy indeed it was. “Three British regiments,” they said, “the
42nd, 50th, and 52nd, had been entirely destroyed in the action—and Sir
John Moore killed in attempting to charge at their head with the vain
hope of restoring the fortune of the day. The English had lost every thing
which constitutes an army, artillery, horses, baggage, ammunition, magazines,
and military chests. Of eighty pieces of cannon they had landed,
they had re-embarked no more than 12,—200,000 weight of powder,
16,000 muskets, and 2,000,000 of treasure (about 83,000<i>l.</i>), had fallen
into the hands of the pursuers, and treasure yet more considerable had
been thrown down the precipices along the road between Astorga and
Corunna, where the peasantry and the soldiers were now collecting it.
Five thousand horses had been counted which they had slaughtered upon
the way—five hundred were taken at Corunna, and the carcases of twelve
hundred were infecting the streets when the conquerors entered that town.
The English would have occupied Ferrol, and seized the squadron there,
had it not been for the precipitance of their retreat, and the result of the
battle to which they had been brought at last. Thus, then, had terminated
their expedition into Spain! Thus, after having fomented the war in that
unhappy country, had they abandoned it to its fate! In another season
of the year not a man of them would have escaped; now, the facility of
breaking up the bridges, the rapidity of the winter torrents, shortness of
days, and length of nights, had favoured their retreat.”</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_83" href="#FNanchor_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> “Before the further actions of the British are narrated, a few pages
will be well bestowed to recount the heroic, but unconnected efforts of
resistance made by the Spaniards themselves, of which the siege of Zaragoza
stands foremost. Immediately after the repulse of the French in the
preceding summer, Palafox directed the execution of various defensive
works, which, thrown up in haste, and executed with greater zeal than
judgment, gave more the appearance than the reality of additional strength
to the place; yet, in the defence of them, Palafox added much to his
previously high fame,—this second defence being far more arduous than
the former; as thirty-six thousand men were employed in the attack, and
such a provision of artillery and stores brought against the town, as rendered
success certain. From the day succeeding the unfortunate action at
Tudela, constant skirmishing and small affairs of posts took place, whilst
the French were bringing up the supplies for the attack; which having
accomplished, the siege commenced on the 20th December, by the assault
and capture of the outposts of the Torrero and Casa-blanca; and by an
attempt to lodge in the suburbs on the left of the Elbro, from which, after
several hours’ fighting, and a dreadful slaughter of the Spaniards, the
French were ultimately repulsed. On the 10th January a violent bombardment
began, and frequently three thousand shells were thrown into
the devoted town in twenty-four hours. On the 26th, fifty-five pieces of
heavy ordnance battered the newly-raised works of the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">enceinte</i>, and
quickly formed a practicable breach: the French vigorously assaulted it
the following morning, and, after a desperate resistance, gained the summit;
where, however, they could not maintain themselves, as the citizens,
from behind an interior retrenchment, kept up an incessant fire, and every
moment sallied forth and fought hand to hand with the troops and workmen
endeavouring to form the lodgment. In these fierce encounters,
women and priests were observed among the foremost and most courageous;
and openly to contend with such enthusiasm was hopeless. The
besiegers, therefore, confined themselves to the slow but certain operations
of the sap, and by its insidious advances on the 6th, penetrated into the
principal street, named the Corso, where the buildings are of great solidity.
Then the conflict assumed the greatest degree of obstinacy—each house
became a citadel, and required to be separately attacked; mining was the
art employed, and the courage of the unpractised Arragonese failed before
the skill of their more experienced antagonists. They nevertheless made
the most surprising efforts: when forced from one room, they renewed the
combat in the next; and frequently, when driven inch by inch out of a
building, Palafox, by a desperate and bold offensive movement, recovered
it, and the enemy had the same resistance a second time to overcome. But
courage alone is of little avail against courage and science united: daily
and hourly the French made some advance; and when exertion was most
required, a pestilential disorder, arising from the number of the unburied
slain, broke out among the defenders, causing far more havoc than the
sword. At last the heroic Palafox himself sickened, and affairs became
desperate. Still the constancy of these dauntless Spaniards remained
unshaken; and a priest of the name of Ric, by his personal example and
the enthusiasm he inspired, directed the defence of the few remaining
streets with undiminished bravery; and at last, on the 20th February, after
thirty thousand citizens had buried themselves under the ruins of their
houses, he, by firmness of conduct, forced Marshal Lannes to promise
good treatment to the survivors.
</p>
<p>
“The garrison, fifteen thousand in number, marched out, and laid down
their arms, after a resistance of fifty-two days open trenches, twenty-three
of which were a war of houses. The town, on entering it, presented a
dreadful and melancholy spectacle; entire districts of it were demolished
by repeated explosions, and presented merely a mass of ruins, thickly
spread over with mutilated limbs and carcasses; the few houses which fire
and the mine had spared, were riddled by shot and shells; their interiors
were cut through with communications, the walls loopholed, the doors
and windows barricaded, and the streets blocked up with numberless traverses.
The dirt, corruption, and misery attending the crowding together
of more than one hundred thousand souls into a city calculated for only
forty thousand, with all the hardships attendant on a long siege, had generated
a frightful epidemic, more relentless than the sword.
</p>
<p>
“In the midst of the ruins and bodies with which the streets were filled,
were observed here and there crawling along a few inhabitants, pale, emaciated,
and cast down, who seemed on the point of following their dead
comrades whom they had been unable to remove. From an enumeration
made at the commencement and at the termination of this extraordinary
and terrible siege, it has been ascertained that in fifty-two days, fifty-four
thousand individuals perished; being two-thirds of the military, and the
half of the inhabitants or refugees. The loss of the besiegers did not exceed
three thousand. * * * * *
</p>
<p>
“In no place would they have imagined themselves so secure as in
Zaragoza itself, which had been so wonderfully defended and delivered,
and which they believed to be invincible through the protection of Our
Lady of the Pillar, who had chosen it for the seat of her peculiar worship.
During the former siege, prints of that idol had been distributed by women
in the heat of action, and worn by the men in their hats both as a badge
and an amulet. The many remarkable escapes and deliverances which had
occurred were ascribed not to all-ruling and omnipotent Providence, but to
the immediate interference of the <i>Magna Mater</i> of Zaragoza.
</p>
<p>
“Palafox himself had been trained up with more than common care in
the superstition of the place; he and his brethren in their childhood had
been taken every day to attend mass in the Holy Chapel where the image
was enshrined, dressed at such times in the proper costume of the Infantes,
as a mark of greater honour to the present goddess. An appearance in the
sky, which at other times might have passed unremembered, and perhaps
unnoticed, had given strong confirmation to the popular faith. About a
month before the commencement of the first siege, a white cloud appeared
at noon, and gradually assumed the form of a palm-tree; the sky being in
all other parts clear, except that a few specks of fleecy cloud hovered about
the larger one. It was first observed over the church of N. Lenora del
Portillo, and moving from thence till it seemed to be immediately above
that of the pillar, continued in the same form about half an hour, and then
dispersed. The inhabitants were in a state of such excitement, that crowds
joined in the acclamation of the first beholder, who cried out, ‘a miracle!’
and after the defeat of the besiegers had confirmed the omen, a miracle it
was universally pronounced to have been, the people proclaiming with
exultation that the Virgin had by this token prefigured the victory she had
given them, and promised Zaragoza her protection as long as the world
should endure.”—<i>Southey.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_84" href="#FNanchor_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> “In all this view of the case, the loss of the bridge of Amarante is a
great misfortune, and is the greater from the manner in which it was lost.
Our friend says, it was carried by the French making two false attacks on
the right, under cover of which they mined the barricade on the bridge,
which was very strong, and blew it up in the morning at daylight; threw
a column over it, which surprised the Portuguese asleep; and they were
unable to blow it up as was intended. The French carried every thing
before them.”—<i>Wellington’s Despatches.</i>
</p>
<p>
“To call off the attention of the Portuguese guard, some twenty men
were stationed to keep up a fire upon the intrenchments, so directed as
not to endanger the sappers, who had volunteered for the real service of
the hour. It was a service so hopeful and hazardous as to excite the liveliest
solicitude for its success. The barrel was covered with a grey cloak,
that it might neither be heard nor seen, and the man who undertook to
deposit it in its place wore a cloak of the same colour. The clear moonlight
was favourable to the adventure, by the blackness of the shadow
which the parapet on one side produced. In that line of darkness the
sapper crept along at full length, pushing the barrel before him with his
head, and guiding it with his hands. His instructions were to stop if he
heard the slightest movement on the Portuguese side: and a string was
fastened to one of his feet by which the French were enabled to know how
far he had advanced, and to communicate with him. Having placed the
barrel, and uncovered that part where it was to be kindled, he returned
with the same caution. Four barrels, one after the other, were thus
arranged without alarming the Portuguese. The fourth adventurer had
not the same command of himself as his predecessors had evinced. Possessed
either with fear, or premature exultation, as soon as he had deposited
the barrel in its place, instead of making his way back slowly and
silently along the line of shadow, he rose and ran along the middle of the
bridge in the moonlight. He was seen, fired at, and shot in the thigh.
But the Portuguese did not take the alarm as they ought to have done;
they kept up a fire upon the entrance of the bridge, and made no attempt
to discover for what purpose their intrenchments had been approached so
closely.
</p>
<p>
“Four hours had elapsed before the four barrels were placed; by that
time it was midnight, and in another hour, when the Portuguese had ceased
their fire, a fifth volunteer proceeded in the same manner with a saucisson<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a>
fastened to his body: this he fixed in its place, and returned safely. By
two o’clock this part of the business was completed, and Laborde was informed
that all was ready. Between three and four a fog arose from the
river and filled the valley, so that the houses on the opposite shore could
scarcely be discerned through it. This was favourable for the assailants.
The saucisson was fired, and the explosion, as Bouchard had expected,
threw down the intrenchments, and destroyed also the apparatus for communicating
with the mine. The French rushed forward: some threw
water into the mine, others cleared the way; the fog increased the confusion
into which the Portuguese were thrown by being thus surprised:
they made so little resistance that the French lost only nine men.”—<i>Southey.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1a"><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Saucisson</i> is a pipe or hose filled with gunpowder, which reaches from
the chamber of the mine to the gallery. It is used for firing mines, bomb-chests,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> “Our arrival at the camp was announced by a general discharge of
artillery, upon which an immense number of torches were made to blaze
up, and we passed the entire Spanish line in review by their light. The
effect produced by these arrangements was one of no ordinary character.
As the torches were held aloft, at moderate intervals from one another,
they threw a red and wavering light over the whole scene, permitting, at
the same time, its minuter parts to be here and there cast into shade;
whilst the grim and swarthy visages of the soldiers, their bright arms and
dark uniforms, appeared peculiarly picturesque as often as the flashes fell
upon them. Then there was the frequent roar of cannon, the shouldering
of firelocks, mingled with the brief word of command, and rattling of
accoutrements and arms, as we passed from battalion to battalion; all these
served to interest the sense of hearing to the full as much as the spectacle
attracted the sense of sight. Nor was old Cuesta himself an object to be
passed by without notice, even at such a moment and under such circumstances
as these. The old man preceded us,—not so much sitting on his
horse as held upon it by two pages,—at the imminent hazard of being
overthrown whenever a cannon was discharged, or a torch flared out with
peculiar brightness; indeed his physical debility was so remarkable, as
clearly to mark his total unfitness for the situation which he then held. As
to his mental powers, he gave us little opportunity of judging; inasmuch
as he scarcely uttered five words during the continuance of our visit; but
his corporal infirmities alone were at absolute variance with all a general’s
duties, and shewed that he was now fit only for the retirement of private
life.
</p>
<p>
“In this manner we passed about six thousand cavalry, drawn up in rank
entire, and not less than twenty battalions of infantry, each consisting of
perhaps from seven to eight hundred men. These formed but one portion
of the army, the rest being either at the bridge of Arrobispo, or in position
along the Tagus; and they were all, with a few exceptions, remarkably
fine men: speaking of them in the aggregate, they were little better than
bold peasantry, armed partially like soldiers, but completely unacquainted
with a soldier’s duty. This remark applied fully as much to the cavalry
as to the infantry. The horses were many of them good, but their riders
manifestly knew nothing of movement or discipline; and they were, as
well on this account as on the score of a miserable equipment, quite unfit
for general service. The artillery, again, was numerous, but totally unlike,
both in order and arrangement, to that of other armies; and the generals
appeared to have been selected according to one rule alone, namely, that
of seniority. They were almost all old men; and except O’Donaju and
Largas, evidently incapable of bearing the fatigues or surmounting the
difficulties of one hard campaign.
</p>
<p>
“The place at which we paid this visit, and witnessed these events, was
called Casa del Puertos; where the head-quarters of the Spanish army
were established in a wretched hovel. We alighted here after the review
had ended, and as soon as we entered, Cuesta, who seemed quite overpowered
by fatigue, retired to rest; but he returned again at eleven o’clock
to supper, and sat with us till past midnight. He sat, however, as he
always did under similar circumstances, in profound silence, neither seeking
to take a share in the conversation, nor, apparently at least, paying
the slightest attention to it.
</p>
<p>
“After a secret conference between Cuesta and Sir Arthur ended, dinner
was announced; and we sat down, at three o’clock, to about forty dishes,
the principal ingredients in which were garlic and onions. Our meal did
not occupy us long; and on Cuesta retiring, as was his custom, to enjoy
his siesta, we mounted our horses, and rode out into the camp. By this
means we were enabled to see more of the regiments separately than we
had seen during the torch-light review. We saw, however, nothing which
served in any degree to raise our opinion of the general efficiency of our
allies; and we returned to our host at a late hour, more than ever impressed
with the persuasion, that if the deliverance of the Peninsula was to
be effected at all, it must be done, not by the Spaniards, but by ourselves.”—<i>Lord
Londonderry.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> “I find General Cuesta more and more impracticable every day. It
is impossible to do business with him, and very uncertain that any operation
will succeed in which he has any concern. O’Donoju expresses himself
to be heartily tired of him, and has declared that he will quit him at
the first moment he is unsuccessful. He has quarrelled with some of his
principal officers; and I understand that all are dissatisfied with him, for
the manner in which he has conducted his operations near this place.
</p>
<p>
“He contrived to lose the whole of yesterday, in which, although his
troops were under arms, and mine in march, we did nothing owing to the
whimsical perverseness of his disposition; but that omission I consider
fortunate, as we have dislodged the enemy without a battle, in which the
chances were not much in our favour. His want of communication with his
officers of the plan settled with me for the 22nd, and his absence from the
field, were the cause that we did the French but little mischief on that day;
and of these circumstances his officers are aware.”—<i>Wellington’s Despatches.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> Between the British and French, even in military duty, the courtesies
of society were respected, and an interchange of kind and gentlemanly
civilities was not unfrequent, as will be evidenced by the following anecdotes:—
</p>
<p>
“While Hasparen was the head-quarters of the fifth division, the pickets
of both armies avoided every appearance of hostility. Each occupied a
hill, with sentries about two hundred yards apart. The French on one
occasion pushed forward their videttes, and seemed as if they designed to
trespass on the neutral ground. The captain of the English picket reported
this encroachment, and received orders not to allow it. On the following
morning, he observed that the French vidette had been advanced about
fifty yards, and he thought it most advisable to demand an interview with
the French captain of chasseurs. A peasant was despatched, and returned
with a message, that the commandant would wait upon the British officer
immediately; and, in a few minutes, the parties met on the neutral
ground. The Briton stated the orders he had received and explained, that,
to avoid so <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lâche</i> a proceeding as to fire upon a vidette, he had solicited a
meeting with the brave chasseur. The Frenchman expressed himself in
the most flattering terms, and begged that the hussar might point out a
situation which would be agreeable to him. A thorn bush, about one
hundred yards behind the spot the French vidette was posted upon, was
mentioned as equally advantageous for the security of the French picket;
while it would be such as the hussar was permitted by his orders to allow.
The chasseur gave orders accordingly, the vidette was placed at the very
spot which was recommended, and the Frenchman, having expressed his
satisfaction at the interview, produced a bottle of cogniac; two or three
officers on each side now joined the party; a happy termination to the war
was drunk; and the captain, whose name was (we think) Le Brun, said,
he trusted that it would not be the fate of war to bring into collision
the parties who had met in so amicable a manner.”
</p>
<p>
Again. “I have known several instances of right feeling evinced by
the enemy, worthy of gentlemen who are above turning into individual
strife the quarrels of the two countries. While the light division was at
Gallegos, some greyhounds belonging to an officer strayed into the enemies’
lines, and an opportunity was found, by means of the first flag of
truce, to request their being returned. The answer was favourable, stating
that they should be sent in on the first opportunity. A day or two after
the enemy made a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnoissance</i>, and when their skirmishers were thrown
out, the greyhounds were seen in couples in the rear, and on the first carbine
being fired, they were let slip (the dogs of war?), and came curveting
through the whistling balls to their old masters.”—<i>Recollections by
a Subaltern.</i>
</p>
<p>
There seemed to have existed between these noble armies an honourable
confidence, that was often tried and never violated.
</p>
<p>
A descriptive passage of the advance across the Pyrenees runs thus:—“We
perceived, not twenty yards off, a wounded voltigeur extended on
the ground, and a young comrade supporting him. The Frenchman never
attempted to retreat, but smiled when we came up, as if he had been expecting
us. ‘Good morning,’ he said; ‘I have been waiting for you,
gentlemen. My poor friend’s leg is broken by a shot, and I could not
leave him till you arrived, lest some of these Portuguese brigands should
murder him.—Pierre,’ he continued, as he addressed his companion, ‘here
are the brave English, and you will be taken care of. I will leave you a
flask of water, and you will soon be succoured by our noble enemy. Gentlemen,
will you honour me by emptying this canteen. You will find it
excellent, for I took it from a portly friar two days ago.’ There was no
need to repeat the invitation. I set the example, the canteen passed from
mouth to mouth, and the monk’s brandy vanished. The conscript—for
he had not joined above a month—replenished the flask with water from
a spring just by. He placed it in his comrade’s hand, bade him an affectionate
farewell, bowed gracefully to us, threw his musket over his
shoulder, and trotted off to join his regiment, which he pointed out upon
a distant height. He seemed never for a moment to contemplate the
possibility of our sending him in durance to the rear; and there were
about him such kindness and confidence, that on our part no one ever
dreamed of detaining him.”—<i>The Bivouac.</i>
</p>
<p>
Again. “From the 3rd until the 12th of July the two armies remained
in presence of each other, encamped on the sides of a river, which at times
is a formidable sheet of water, but which was then little more than an
insignificant stream. Nevertheless, although both armies kept their guards
on their respective sides of the water, and that the movements of each
were cautiously watched, not one life was lost, nor one shot fired by either
army.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, so different from hostility was the conduct of both nations,
that the French and British lived upon the most amicable terms. If we
wanted wood for the construction of huts, our men were allowed to pass
without molestation to the French side of the river to cut it. Each day
the soldiers of both armies used to bathe together in the same stream, and
an exchange of rations, such as biscuit and rum, between the French and
our men, was by no means uncommon.”—<i>Reminiscences of a Subaltern.</i>
</p>
<p>
The reverses which attend even successful warfare occasionally require
its rigours to be softened. The French and English felt this—and those
who had the misfortune to be prisoners or wounded, received the greatest
care circumstances would allow, and had baggage or money conveyed to
them from their friends with strict fidelity. The tables of the commanding
officers were open to their captives—their wounds were carefully
dressed—and in some cases their escape connived at. A parole of honour
insured the fullest liberty to the giver; but when it was not required or
was refused, the prisoners were subjected to the least possible restraint
consistent with security, and treated with gentlemanly attention.
</p>
<p>
“During three days that some British officers were at Castel Legos as
prisoners of war, with a very slender guard, indeed almost nominal, they
were treated by General Villatte with the utmost kindness. He sent
dinner to them from his own table, with abundance of wine. His aide-de-camp
and brother-in-law, Captain Cholet, visited them twice each day,
to see that they wanted for nothing; and two, and sometimes three, surgeons
visited them (by order) twice a day to dress their wounds. In fine,
the greatest possible kindness and attention were shewn to them; and even
their escape, on the night of the 31st of August, was easily effected, if not
connived at, as the French retired without insisting on the officers being
taken away, although carts had been provided.”
</p>
<p>
But a noble instance of an enemy’s humanity remains to be recorded—and
with a similar instance of humane feeling displayed to a friend and
not an enemy, we shall close these anecdotes.
</p>
<p>
“When the assault on St. Sebastian failed, and our troops retreated to
the trenches, the enemy advanced beyond his defences, or clustered on
the ramparts, shouting defiance, and threatening a descent in pursuit. To
check this movement, an animated fire of round and grape was opened
from our battery, the thickest of which fell on a particular part of the
breach where lay a solitary grenadier of the Royals, shot through both
legs, and unable to extricate himself from his awfully perilous situation.
His fate appeared inevitable; when a French officer stepped forward,
walked coolly through the hottest of our fire, lifted his wounded enemy
in his arms, and bore him off, himself unhurt.”
</p>
<p>
The subsequent history of Colonel St. Angelo, as the gallant Frenchman
was named, is curious, and instances the vicissitudes of fortune to which
a soldier is exposed. On the fall of the fortress he was sent a prisoner
to England, but, as his humanity well deserved, he was instantly liberated
and sent home. On his arrival in Paris, Napoleon, having been apprised
of his gallant conduct, promoted him to a regiment on service in the
Peninsula. Thither he repaired—joined his new regiment, and in an
attack on our posts was a second time made prisoner. Thus, as a prisoner
he had visited England—had resided in Paris—been presented to
the Emperor—promoted to a regiment—and made a prisoner again—and
all within the space of six weeks from the taking of St. Sebastian!
</p>
<p>
The following interesting anecdote is thus told by Mr. Grattan:—“Nearly
at the opening of the battle of Salamanca, a considerable body
of the enemy’s tirailleurs pressed forward to that part of the ridge occupied
by the third division, and immediately in front of the 88th regiment,
the light infantry company of which, commanded by Captain Robert
Nickle, was ordered to drive back this force: he did so in the most gallant
manner; but the enemy could ill brook such a defeat, the more
annoying, as it was witnessed by the whole division, as also by a considerable
portion of one of the enemy’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i>. A reinforcement,
commanded by an officer of distinction, rushed forward to redeem the
tarnished honour of their nation, while some of the battalion-men of the
Connaught Rangers, seeing the unequal contest their light infantry company
were about to be engaged in—for the French were upwards of one
hundred to sixty of ours—hastened to take a part in the fray. The detachment
of the 88th lay behind a low ditch, and waited until the French
approached to within a few yards of them; they came on in gallant style,
headed by their brave commanding officer, who was most conspicuous,
being several paces in front of his men. The soldiers of the two armies,
posted at a distance, and lookers-on at this national trial, shouted with
joy as they beheld their respective comrades on the eve of engaging with
each other. But this feeling on the part of the French was of but short
duration, for at the first fire, their detachment turned tail, and were what
they themselves would term ‘culbutés,’ leaving their brave commandant,
with many others, mortally wounded behind. Captain Robert Nickle ran
up to his bleeding opponent, and rendered him every assistance in his
power. He then advanced alone, with his handkerchief tied on the point
of his sword, which he held up as a token of amity, and, thus re-assured,
some of the French soldiers returned without their arms, and carried
away their officer with them. They were delighted with the considerate
conduct of Captain Nickle, and embraced our men on parting.”—<i>Reminiscences
of a Subaltern.</i>
</p>
<p>
“The terms of mutual respect in which the British and French soldiers
held each other, and the friendly intercourse it frequently led to, have
been noticed by every writer on the Peninsular war. Nor was this confined
to out-post duty only—the soldiers engaged on which seemed by a
tacit agreement, and as a point of honour perfectly understood on both
sides, to have agreed to avoid the unnecessary destruction of life; and, as
far as consistent with duty, perhaps a little beyond what was strictly so,
to testify the respect with which they had inspired each other. The
officers of the two armies were also not unfrequently thrown into situations
where they had the opportunity of evincing similar feelings. Of
this an instance comes to the writer’s<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> recollection, as happening, among
others, at the battle of Fuentes d’Onoro. On the morning of the 5th,
when the French made their attack upon the right of our position, the
writer of this note was at the time in conversation with an officer of a
picket of the enemy in his front, where there was no prospect of the
lines being immediately engaged; seeing the state of things which then
ensued, after a mutual exchange of civilities, both parties retired to their
respective posts, and were soon after engaged in warm conflict.”

<p>
The following anecdote is highly honourable to the Duke of Belluno:—When
Victor entered the town<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> he found some of the wounded, French
and English alike, lying on the ground in the Plaza. After complimenting
the English, and observing that they understood the laws and courtesies
of war, he told them there was one thing which they did not understand,
and that was how to deal with the Spaniards. He then sent soldiers
to every house, with orders to the inhabitants immediately to receive and
accommodate the wounded of the two nations, who were lodged together,
one English and one Frenchman; and he expressly directed that the
Englishmen should always be served first.</p></div>

slaves of habit, that it was considered as one great evil of the siege that
they had no means of grinding it: two horse-mills, which had been
erected, were of such clumsy construction, that they did not perform half
the needful work; and the Geronans, rather than prepare the unground
corn in any way to which they had not been accustomed, submitted to the
labour of grinding it between two stones, or pounding it in the shell of a
bomb with a cannon-ball. For want of other animal food, mules and
horses were slaughtered for the hospital and for the shambles; a list was
made of all within the city, and they were taken by lot. Fuel was exceedingly
scarce, yet the heaps which were placed in cressets at the corners of
the principal streets, to illuminate them in case of danger, remained untouched,
and not a billet was taken from them during the whole siege.
The summer fever became more prevalent; the bodies of the sufferers
were frequently covered with a minute eruption, which was usually a fatal
symptom: fluxes also began to prevail.

“Augereau now straitened the blockade; and, that the garrison might
neither follow the example of O’Donnell, nor receive any supplies, however
small, he drew his lines closer, stretched cords with bells along the
interspaces, and kept watch-dogs at all the posts. The bombardment was
continued, and always with greater violence during the night than the day,
as if to exhaust the Geronans by depriving them of sleep.

“There did not remain a single building in Gerona which had not been
injured by the bombardment; not a house was habitable; the people slept
in cellars, and vaults, and holes, amid the ruins; and it had not unfrequently
happened that the wounded were killed in the hospitals. The
streets were broken up, so that the rain-water and the sewers stagnated
there: and the pestilential vapours which arose were rendered more
noxious by the dead bodies which lay rolling amid the ruins. The siege
had now endured seven months; scarcely a woman had become pregnant
during that time: the very dogs, before hunger consumed them, had
ceased to follow after their kind; they did not even fawn upon their
masters; the almost incessant thunder of artillery seemed to make them
sensible of the state of the city, and the unnatural atmosphere affected
them as well as human kind. It even affected vegetation. In the gardens
within the walls the fruits withered, and scarcely any vegetable could be
raised. Within the last three weeks above five hundred of the garrison
had died in the hospitals: a dysentery was raging and spreading; the sick
were lying upon the ground, without beds, almost without food; and there
was scarcely fuel to dress the little wheat that remained, and the few horses
which were yet unconsumed.”—<i>Southey.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> “Gerona surrendered on the 10th December, after a memorable
defence of six months, which places the name of the governor, Don Marian
Alvarez, on a level with that of Palafox; and some particulars of his
heroic conduct deserve to be recorded. The town stands low, at the confluence
of the Ona and Ter rivers, which cover and protect the northern
side; and on the opposite quarter the approaches are commanded by a
small square fort of ninety toises exterior side, situated on a height of five
hundred and fifty yards from the place called Montjuic. In this petty
work, Alvarez, not having altogether five thousand men under his command,
defied for three months the utmost efforts of General St. Cyr with
twenty thousand French. Sixty pieces of heavy ordnance fired against the
fort incessantly for twenty-two days, which, besides effecting an enormous
breach, levelled all the upper works. The enemy then offered terms,
which being rejected, they gave the assault, and were repulsed with loss.
During the three succeeding days the besiegers’ batteries thundered without
intermission, and on the fourth morning they again tried the force of
arms. Several heavy columns advanced to the breach, and persisted in
their attempts to ascend it with so much courage and obstinacy, that success
was long balanced, and on their repulse, sixteen hundred killed and
wounded remained in the ditch. After this effort, the French, finding all
open attacks useless, resorted to the sap and the mine, and one entire
month passed in the dispute of a ravelin, which (after several attempts to
form a lodgment in it had failed) remained, as if by tacit agreement, unoccupied
by either party, and all personal conflict ceased. The fire of artillery
and the mine, however, gradually levelled the walls, and blew up the
very interior of the place; when, there being no longer any thing worth
disputing, the garrison withdrew on the 11th of August.

One of Julian’s exploits is thus related:—“It was the custom of the
French garrison of Badajoz to send out their cattle every morning beyond
the walls for the purpose of grazing, under the protection of a guard,
which at once tended them, and watched the movements of our parties.
Don Julian determined, if possible, to surprise the herd; for which purpose
he concealed his people, day after day, among the broken ground on
the bank of the river, not far from the town; but the guard proved for a
time so vigilant, that no opportunity occurred of effecting his design. At
last, however, an accident occurred which enabled him to accomplish, not
only his original purpose, but one which he did not dream of accomplishing.
It so happened, that on the morning of the 15th of October, General
Regnaud, the governor of the place, rode out, attended by his staff and a
slender escort, and ventured incautiously to pass the Agueda, at the very
spot where Don Julian’s ambuscade lay concealed. He was instantly
surrounded by the Spanish cavalry and made prisoner; and, as if fortune
had determined to reward the latter for their patience, the cattle appeared
at the same moment at a sufficient distance from the walls to authorize an
attack. The attack was made with the must perfect success, and both
governor and cattle were conveyed in triumph to our head-quarters. In
a native of any country, except France, such an unlucky coincidence would
have produced a degree of gloom not to be shaken off; but by General
Regnaud his misfortunes were borne with the utmost philosophy and
good humour. He became a frequent guest at Lord Wellington’s table,
and we found him an extremely entertaining as well as intelligent companion.”—<i>Lord
Londonderry.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> “The enemy’s force did not exceed thirty cavalry and two hundred
infantry; but they were advantageously posted in an open space, just
beyond a narrow defile; and to reach them it was necessary to thread that
defile in a long line. The consequence was, that though the hussars who
led, formed up in succession as they got through, and charged their opponents
with great gallantry, they effected nothing more than the dispersion
of the handful of horse; for the infantry had time to form a square, and
not all the efforts of our people could succeed in breaking it. The hussars
rode bravely up to the bayonets, but were repulsed by a volley closely
thrown in, which killed or wounded upwards of a dozen men. The
remainder wheeled off, and pursuing the French cavalry, made way for a
squadron of the 16th. These galloped forward, but also took to the left,
and leaving the infantry uninjured, joined in pursuit of the cavalry. When
the last charge was made, the French square was without fire, every man
having discharged his piece, and none having been able to load again; but
when a third attempt was made, they were better prepared to receive it.
It fell to the lot of Colonel Talbot of the 14th to lead this attack. It was
made with daring intrepidity; but the enemy remained perfectly steady,
and reserving their fire till the bridles of the horses touched their bayonets,
gave it with such effect, that Colonel Talbot, with several of his men, were
killed on the spot. The rest drew off—upon which General Craufurd,
despairing of success by the exertions of cavalry alone, despatched an
orderly to bring up a detachment of the 43rd, which chanced to be at no
great distance.
</p>
<p>
“Whilst this was doing, the enemy’s little column began its retreat,
which it conducted with singular steadiness and great order. The 14th
dragoons, seeing this, prepared to launch another squadron against it; and
it was already in speed for the purpose, when Colonel Arenschild, of the
hussars, observed cavalry advancing both in front and flank, and checked
the movement. It was much to be regretted afterwards that he took this
step, for the horse which alarmed him proved to be detachments from our
own people on their return from pursuing the enemy’s dragoons, the whole
of whom they had captured. The French infantry lost no time in availing
themselves of the indecision of our cavalry. They marched on, and
returned to their main body, without having lost a single prisoner, or suffered
in killed or wounded.”—<i>Lord Londonderry.</i></p></div>

the horse-artillery, stationed at a small brook, about half a mile to the
rear of Gallegos. These instantly opened upon the French column; but
though the fire was well-directed, and evidently galled them, it did not
succeed in stopping them. Our cavalry, in the mean while, formed in the
rear of the guns, sending out three or four squadrons, with the hussars,
to skirmish; and rather a sharp contest took place near a bridge which
crossed the brook. The French made a dash to secure it, and passed some
officers, with about thirty or forty men, to the other side; in accomplishing
which however, as the bridge was extremely narrow, they were compelled
to defile from column. An opportunity was thus afforded of
attacking them to advantage, which was not permitted to escape. Captain
Crackenbourg, of the German hussars, an officer of gallantry and high
character, saw in a moment the predicament into which they had thrust
themselves. He instantly drew out two divisions of the hussars, and
charging the body which had passed the bridge, cut down their officer, and
drove the rest, with the loss of several killed and wounded, back upon the
column. The affair was accomplished in an instant, but the promptitude
and vigour which characterized its execution both merited and received
the approbation of all present. The brave men were saluted by the cheers
of their comrades as they returned, and the officer’s name was justly and
honourably mentioned at head quarters.”—<i>Lord Londonderry.</i></p></div>

towards the bridge, which was still crowded with the passing troops.
M’Leod, a very young man, but with a natural genius for war, immediately
turned his horse round, called to the troops to follow, and taking off
his cap, rode with a shout towards the enemy: the suddenness of the
thing, and the distinguished action of the man, produced the effect he
designed—a mob of soldiers rushed after him, cheering and charging as if
a whole army had been at their backs, and the enemy’s skirmishers,
astonished at this unexpected movement, stopped short. Before they
could recover from their surprise, the 52nd crossed the river, and M’Leod,
following at full speed, gained the other side also without disaster.”

“During the fight, General Picton came up alone from Pinhel. Craufurd
desired the support of the third division, it was refused, and, excited
by some previous disputes, the generals separated after a sharp altercation.
Picton was decidedly wrong, because Craufurd’s situation was one of extreme
danger; he durst not retire, and Massena might, undoubtedly, have
thrown his reserves by the bridge of Castello Bom upon the right flank of
the division and destroyed it.”

“It was at first supposed that Lieutenant Dawson and half a company
of the 52nd, which had been posted in the unfinished tower, were also
captured; but that officer kept close until the evening, and then, with
great intelligence, passed all the enemy’s posts, and crossing the Coa at a
ford, rejoined his regiment.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

the first intimation of danger, he lost no time in establishing his cowardice.
“The major of artillery” is also lauded for his conduct “during the
siege;” but it appears that he, too, took the earliest opportunity to prove

The exact strength of the allies was, 23,868 infantry, 2,870 cavalry, and
about 2,000 artillery; making 28,738 British soldiers. The Portuguese

term an establishment is designated where those brethren, whose piety flies
the highest pitch, may at once enjoy the advantages of the eremite and
the discipline of the cenobite life, and thus indulge the heroism of ascetic
devotion in security. The convent, surrounded by an extensive and almost
impervious wood, stands in what may be called the crater of the loftiest
part of the ridge; its precincts, which included a circumference of about
four miles, were walled in. Within that circuit were various chapels and
religious stations; and on the summit of the mountain, which is within
the enclosure, a stone cross was erected of enormous size upon so huge a
foundation that three thousand cart-loads of stone were employed in constructing
its base. The cells of the brethren were round the church, not
in a regular building, but accommodated to the irregularities of the ground,
and lined with cork, which was everywhere used instead of wood, because
of the dampness of the situation. Every cell had its garden and its watercourse
for irrigating it, the cultivation of these little spots being the only
recreation which the inhabitants allowed themselves as lawful. In one of
these gardens the first cedars which grew in Portugal were raised. It was
indeed one of those places where man has converted an earthly paradise
into a purgatory for himself, but where superstition almost seems sanctified
by everything around it. Lord Wellington’s head-quarters were in the

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> A singular circumstance, which occurred that night in the bivouac of
Craufurd’s division, is thus related:
</p>
<p>
“One of those extraordinary panics that, in ancient times, were attributed
to the influence of a hostile god, took place. No enemy was near,
no alarm was given, yet suddenly the troops, as if seized with a frenzy,
started from sleep, and dispersed in every direction; nor was there any
possibility of allaying this strange terror, until some persons called out
that the enemy’s cavalry were among them, when the soldiers mechanically
ran together in masses, and the illusion was instantly dissipated.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_113" href="#FNanchor_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> “At this time the 45th were engaged with numbers out of proportion,
but they gallantly maintained their ground. The 5th, 74th, and
83rd, were likewise attacked; but the 88th, from the nature of their situation,
came in contact with the full body of the enemy, and, while opposed
to three times their own number in front, were assailed on their left by a
couple of hundred riflemen stationed in the rocks. Colonel Wallace
changed his front, but had scarcely reached the rocks, when a fire, destructive
as it was animated, assailed him. The moment was a critical one, but
he never lost his presence of mind. He ordered his two first companies
to attack the rocks, while he pressed forward with the remainder of his
regiment against the main body. The 8th Portuguese were close on the
enemy, and opened a well-directed fire, while the 45th were performing
prodigies of valour. At this moment the 88th came up to the assistance
of their comrades, and the three regiments pressed on: a terrific contest
took place; the French fought well, but they had no chance with our men
when we grappled close with them; and they were overthrown, leaving
half of their column on the heath with which the hill was covered.
</p>
<p>
“The French, ranged amphitheatrically one above another, took a murderous
aim at our soldiers in their advance to dislodge—officers as well as
privates became personally engaged in a hand-to-hand fight. Captain
Dunne fought with his sabre, while Captain Dansey made use of a firelock
and bayonet; he received three wounds, and Captain Dunne owed his
life to a sergeant of his company named Brazill, who, seeing his officer in
danger of being overpowered, scrambled to his assistance, and making a
thrust of his halbert at the Frenchman, transfixed him against the rock he
was standing on.

“Referring to their conduct on this occasion, the Duke of Wellington
observes in his despatch, that he never witnessed a more gallant attack
than that made by these two regiments on the division of the enemy which
had then reached the ridge of the Sierra. In addition to this flattering
testimony of his Grace, and in further evidence of the gallantry they displayed,
it will be sufficient to state, that the loss sustained by these two
corps on the occasion amounted to sixteen officers, seven sergeants, and
two hundred and sixty-one men, being nearly one-half of the whole British
loss in the battle.”—<i>Mackie.</i></p></div>

and from five to six thousand wounded. Napier only makes their killed
eight hundred, and their wounded and prisoners about three thousand
seven hundred. Other writers differ as widely in their estimates. The

before relief could be administered. Hard as was their lot, it was
far more happy than that of the villagers in the rear, and on the skirts of
the enemy’s cantonments, whose habitations, plundered of everything, and
occasionally occupied by detachments of French, afforded their owners no
supplies, and only a precarious shelter. Many of these wretched creatures
passed the whole season of winter exposed to its inclemencies in the neighbouring
woods or mountains, subsisting merely on roots and herbs; and
on the advance of the allies returned to their homes, their bodies emaciated
from abstinence, and their intellects impaired by long-continued apprehension;

that they were close upon the British lines, and pointed out to him where
the batteries were, in constructing which he had himself laboured. Had

thirty miles, for which fifty thousand trees had been allotted—on which
three thousand artillerymen and engineers, and seven thousand peasants,

The communion plate and silver lamps and candlesticks vanished in the

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_128" href="#FNanchor_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> The French soldiers had been so long accustomed to plunder, that
they proceeded in their researches for booty of every kind upon a regular
system. They were provided with tools for the work of pillage, and every
piece of furniture in which places of concealment could be constructed
they broke open from behind, so that no valuables could be hidden from
them by any contrivance of that kind. Having satisfied themselves that
nothing was secreted above ground, they proceeded to examine whether
there was any new masonry, or if any part of the cellar or ground-floor
had been disturbed; if it appeared uneven, they dug there: where there
was no such indication, they poured water, and if it were absorbed in one
place faster than another, there they broke the earth. There were men
who at the first glance could pronounce whether any thing had been buried
beneath the soil, and when they probed with an iron rod, or, in default of
it, with sword or bayonet, it was found that they were seldom mistaken
in their judgment. The habit of living by prey called forth, as in beasts,
a faculty of discovering it: there was one soldier whose scent became so
acute, that if he approached the place where wine had been concealed, he
would go unerringly to the spot.
</p>

“Wherever the French bivouacked, the scene was such as might rather
have been looked for in a camp of predatory Tartars than in that of a
civilized people. Food and forage, and skins of wine, and clothes and
church vestments, books and guitars, and all the bulkier articles of wasteful
spoil, were heaped together in their huts with the planks and doors of
the habitations which they had demolished. Some of the men, retaining
amid this brutal service the characteristic activity and cleverness of their
nation, fitted up their huts with hangings from their last scene of pillage,
with a regard to comfort hardly to have been expected in their situation,
and a love of gaiety only to be found in Frenchmen. The idlers were contented
with a tub, and, <i>if the tub were large enough, three or four would
stow themselves in it!</i>”—<i>Southey.</i>
</p>
<p>
It would appear that the English had some little experience in this line
of business as well as the French.
</p>
<p>
“Some of the dragoons, with a quarter-master, immediately mounted
and followed the French, who were now approaching their goal, and took
little notice of these few horsemen. The quarter-master, however, saw
an opportunity of doing a little business; observing, among those who
lagged in the rear, one man with a ledger in the slings of his knapsack, he
naturally concluded that such gear in the French, as in our service,
belonged to those who carried the purse, and, on the strength of this
analogy, he by degrees approached him of the ledger, and returning his
sword, and advancing at speed, he pounced upon his prey, and seizing him
by the collar, shook the musket out of his hands, and bore him off. He
proved to be a paymaster’s clerk, and carried sixty doubloons, then worth
about four guineas each.”—<i>The Hussar.</i></p></div>

and good, were established in the different divisions of the army. At
head-quarters we were fortunate enough to become possessed of an excellent

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> After the battle of Barosa, the wounded of both nations were, from
want of means of transport, necessarily left upon the field of action the
whole night, and part of the following day. General Rousseau, a French
general of division, was of the number; his dog, a white one of the poodle
kind, which had been left in quarters upon the advance of the French
force, finding that the general returned not with those who escaped from
the battle, set out in search of him; found him at night in his dreary resting-place,
and expressed his affliction by moans, and by licking the hands
and feet of his dying master. When the fatal crisis took place, some hours
after, he seemed fully aware of the dreadful change, attached himself closely
to the body, and for three days refused the sustenance which was offered
him.
</p>
<p>
Arrangements having been made for the interment of the dead, the body
of the general was, like the rest, committed to its honourable grave; the
dog lay down upon the earth, which covered the beloved remains, and
evinced by silence and deep dejection his sorrow for the loss he had sustained.
The English commander, General Graham, whose fine feelings
had prompted him to superintend the last duties due to the gallant slain,
observed the friendless mourner, drew him, now no longer resisting, from
the spot, and gave him his protection, which he continued to him until his
death, many years after, at the general’s residence in Perthshire.</p></div>

men and officers closed in confusion towards one point where a thick dust
was rising, and where loud cries and the sparkling of blades and flashing
of pistols indicated some extraordinary occurrence. Suddenly the multitude
was violently agitated, an English shout arose, the mass was rent
asunder, and Norman Ramsay burst forth at the head of his battery, his
horses breathing fire, and stretching like greyhounds along the plain, his
guns bounding like things of no weight, and the mounted gunners in close
and compact order protecting the rear.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

give way, and fell back on more defensible ground in the rear of the village;
when at this moment the 88th, under Colonel Wallace, and led on
by Major-general Mackinnon, was ordered to move up and support them.
This was done in admirable order; and they made so overwhelming a
charge through the streets, that they drove the enemy from the village
with immense loss.” In fact, the charge of the 88th was so brilliant and
decisive, that the French never ventured to enter the streets again.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> The French officers were censured for continuing these attacks on
the village, instead of assailing the right. “At Fuentes d’Onoro the
British army stood, after the right wing was thrown back, on perfectly
open and level ground, one point only resting on the strong village in
question; yet was that strong point constantly attacked, while the army
was left totally unassailed. At Albuera the French employed the whole
of Godinot’s division of infantry in the attack of the village that gives
its name to the battle; yet, when evacuated by Alten’s brigades, it proved
of no use whatever, for the battle was fought and decided on open ground,
at the other extremity of the field, where an entire division of infantry
would probably have turned the fate of the day.”—<i>Raoul.</i></p></div>

the artillery in a singular manner, for always he fired several guns at one
moment with very heavy charges, placing one across the muzzle of

explosion was heard, others destroyed pieces without attracting notice.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

the general, never remarkable for suavity of temper, hastily inquired,
“What the devil were the ——th doing?”—“Faith,” returned his
informant, “I suppose they were asleep.” “Asleep!—What then was
the ——th about?” and he named the next regiment in the line.—“Devil

small fort situated on the heights of Christoval, on the Portuguese side of
the Guadiana, and that the back of the front defence of the castle might
be enfiladed from thence, it became clear, that should the fort be reduced,
and heavy batteries erected within it, no body of men, exposed to their
fire, could stand to dispute a breach in the wall, which formed the sole
defence of the castle. That wall, from its uncovered position, appeared
liable to be battered down from a distance; and as, when in possession of
the castle, the resistance of the town must, under its commanding influence,
cease, Badajoz might by this mode of attack be captured in a fortnight.”—<i>Jones’s

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_141" href="#FNanchor_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Much of the success of a siege depends on the quality and endurance
of its battering train, as well as the accurate service of the guns. In
some of the sieges undertaken by the Duke of Wellington, his artillery
were miserably deficient—and the wonder is how, with such inadequate
means, he effected successful results in such brief time, and under the
greatest disadvantages. A French engineer, in alluding to the sieges,
makes the following observations:—“There sat down before the place a
besieging army of fourteen or fifteen thousand men, including three thousand
Spaniards, and two thousand Portuguese militia; and the artillery to
be employed amounted to forty pieces, among which are to be numbered
four 10-inch and six 8-inch howitzers. Of mortars we possessed none;
eight, therefore, out of the ten howitzers were directed to be used as
such; and our guns, of which two were 24-pounders, and four 16-pounders,
were all brass, and of Portuguese manufacture. The engineers’
stores collected on the occasion comprised three thousand five
hundred intrenching tools, sixty thousand sand-bags, six hundred gabions,
a very few fascines, and an extremely inadequate quantity of splinter-proof
timber and planks; whilst, independently of the officers, there were
attached to the department, one hundred and sixty-nine men of the line,
to act as overseers, forty-eight carpenters, forty-eight miners, and twenty-five
rank and file, of the corps of royal artificers. The chief engineer
and principal director of the operations was Lieutenant-colonel Fletcher.
Major Dixon, of the Portuguese artillery, was at the head of that department;
and Captains Ross and MacLeod were put in charge of two
depôts, which were established on each side of the river.”

“The first siege of Badajoz by the English, being attempted with forty
bronze cannon of Portuguese construction, the whole were rendered
unserviceable in a very short space of time, though loaded with powder
not more than one-third of the weight of the balls, and discharged at the
moderate rate of once only in eight minutes; and the siege miscarried.
The English attributed the quick deterioration of the cannon to the
strength of their powder, and consequently they determined to have no
parks but such as were composed of cast-iron cannon from England.
The latter was the description of artillery which they employed when they
attacked Ciudad Rodrigo in the January following. They established
their batteries at a distance of about 500 yards (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mètres</i>) from the escarp,
and fired upon it incessantly, until they had opened two practicable
breaches; this they effected in two-and-thirty hours and a half’s firing,
and they carried the place in five days. There was not a single cannon
which burst, or suffered injury, though each was fired a very considerable
number of times in constant succession. The siege of Badajoz was
resumed a second time, and the breaching batteries were established at
about 710 yards’ distance (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mètres</i>). The number of cannon brought to
bear was sixteen 24-pounders, twenty-four 18-pounders, and six mortars
of five inches and a half diameter. The attack began on the 30th of
March, and by the 6th of April three practicable breaches were effected;
that in the curtain was forty feet broad; that on the flank ninety feet;
and the third, which was on the face of the bastion, was 150 feet. The
number of hours’ firing was 104, and the number of projectiles discharged
35,246. The results were the same during this siege as at the siege of
Ciudad Rodrigo; not a single cannon burst, or became unserviceable,
though the 24-pounders were fired in constant succession, at the rate of
1249 discharges each.”

“The siege of St. Sebastian affords a third instance of the extreme
endurance of English cast-iron cannon. The breaching batteries, which
were established at a distance of about 660 yards (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mètres</i>) from the place,
opened a breach 100 feet broad in the escarp, against which they were
directed, and it was rendered practicable on the third day after the firing
was first opened. The batteries were composed of thirty-four cannon, of
which twenty were 24-pounders. The same batteries being opened the
next morning, to make a second breach, effected one of thirty feet in
breadth, after fifteen hours and a half’s firing. During this interval each
cannon discharged from 300 to 350 shot without being injured. Had it
been required to produce the same result with brass cannon, three times
as many cannon would have been necessary, supposing the ordinary rate
of firing to have been observed. During this siege, which was twice
resumed, several of the pieces withstood the discharge upwards of 9,000
times in uninterrupted succession, without experiencing any material
damage. Their fire was so accurate at the last attack, that they were
employed in throwing shrapnel-shells, filled with powder and balls, over
the heads of the besiegers, for the purpose of driving away the besieged
who lined the top of the breach. It was one of these shells which set
fire to a quantity of obusses and bombs that stood on the rampart, and
occasioned an explosion, which created so much confusion in the place as
to produce its fall.”—<i>Thierry.</i></p></div>

The following is a graphic but faithful description of a military hospital
after a battle:—
</p>
<p>
“In the yard of a quinta, or nobleman’s house, I looked through the
grating and saw about 200 wounded soldiers waiting to have their limbs
amputated, while others were arriving every moment. It would be difficult
to convey an idea of the frightful appearance of these men; they had
been wounded on the 5th, and this was the 7th; their limbs were swollen
to an enormous size, and the smell from the gun-shot wounds was dreadful.
Some were sitting upright against a wall, under the shade of a number
of chestnut-trees, and, as many of them were wounded in the head as
well as in limbs, the ghastly countenances of those poor fellows presented
a dismal sight. The streams of gore which had trickled down their
cheeks were quite hardened with the sun, and gave their faces a glazed
and copper-coloured hue; their eyes were sunk and fixed; and what
between the effects of the sun, of exhaustion, and despair, they resembled
more a group of bronze figures than any thing human. There they sat,
silent and statue-like, waiting for their turn to be carried to the amputating
tables. At the other side of the yard lay several whose state was too
hopeless for them to sit up; a feeble cry from them occasionally, to those
who were passing, for a drink of water, was all they uttered.
</p>
<p>
“A little farther on, in an inner court, were the surgeons. They were
stripped to their shirts and bloody. Curiosity led me forward: a number
of doors, placed on barrels, served as temporary tables, and on these lay
the different subjects upon whom the surgeons were operating; to the
right and left were arms and legs, flung here and there without distinction,
and the ground was dyed with blood.”

“In an inner room was a young officer shot through the head,—his
was a hopeless case. He was quite delirious, and obliged to be held down
by two men; his strength was astonishing, and more than once, while I
remained, he succeeded in escaping from the grasp of his attendants.
The Scotch officer’s servant soon after came in, and stooping down
inquired of his master how he felt, but received no reply; he had half-turned
on his face; the man took hold of his master’s hand—it was still
warm, but the pulse had ceased—he was dead.”—<i>Reminiscences of a

<p>
“We were about to leave the room when we perceived a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">paillasse</i> in
the corner, which had hitherto escaped our notice; a pelisse of the 18th
hussars served as a coverlet, a little round head was upon the pillow; a
vivid eye, with the countenance of a deadly pallid hue, bespoke a wounded
Irishman. ‘Do you belong to the 18th?‘—‘Yes, plase your honour;’
(the right hand at the same time carried up to the forelock.) ‘Are you
wounded?’—‘Yes, plase your honour;’ (again the hand to the head.)
‘Where?’—‘Run through the body, plase your honour.’ (We verily
believe he said twice through the body, but cannot charge our memory.)
‘Are you in pain?’—‘Och! plase your honour, I’m tolerably asy; the
Frinch daacter blid me, and to-morrow I shall see the old rigiment.’ It
is needless to say that we were deeply interested in this gallant fellow,
who bore his dangerous wounds with so much composure; and it is a
pleasing sequel to this anecdote to be able to state that he finally recovered.”

“Two singular cases of contusion of the brain were observed at this
time in the hospitals: one man did nothing but count, with a loud and deliberate
voice, from forty to seventy, always beginning at one number and
ending at the other, and this incessantly through the whole night. Another
continually uttered the most extraordinary blasphemies and curses,
exhausting the whole vocabulary of malediction, without any apparent
emotion of anger. This case did not prove fatal, but the man was left in
a state of helpless idiocy.”</p></div>

seven thousand six hundred dragoons. The allied force had probably
fifty-five thousand infantry, and some four thousand cavalry. As only a

was much inferior to the French.</p></div>

and a firm reliance on their officers, could have saved those devoted
soldiers from total annihilation. They were attacked, with a fury unexampled,
on three sides of the square; the French horsemen rode upon
their bayonets; but, unshaken by the desperate position in which they
were placed, they poured in their fire with such quickness and precision,
that the cavalry retired in disorder.”

“At the charge made by the whole of the French cavalry at El Bodon
on the square formed by the 5th and 77th regiments, a French officer had
his horse shot under him, and both fell together. The officer, although
not much hurt, lay on the ground as if dead, and in this situation would,
in all probability, have escaped, as the French infantry were fast advancing
to the relief of their cavalry, had it not been for a German hussar,
one squadron of whom were engaged in the conflict, who rode up to the
spot, and made a cut at the officer lying on the ground; on which, he
immediately sprang up, and, with his sword at the guard, set the German
at defiance. Another of the King’s German hussars then galloped up,
and desired the French officer to surrender, which he refused to do.
The appearance of the officer in this position was truly heroic: he stood
without his cap; his head was bare, and some marks of blood were on his
face. From the fine attitude he presented, and being a tall, athletic man,
he strongly impressed the beholders with the belief that he would defend
himself against both the hussars. At this time, Ensign Canch, of the
5th, ran out of the square, and was proceeding rapidly to the place, in
the hope of inducing the officer to surrender himself a prisoner; but the
hussars, finding they were baffled, and could not subdue this brave man
with the sword, had recourse to the pistol, with which they killed him, to
the great regret of the British regiments that were looking on. This
affair took place about halfway between the square already mentioned
and the French cavalry, who were hovering about, after being repulsed by
the 5th and 77th regiments.
</p>

“We were informed by a prisoner taken at the time, that the officer
who defended himself so gallantly against the two hussars, was an Irishman,
and the major of his regiment.”—<i>Reminiscences of a Subaltern.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_150" href="#FNanchor_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> “Marmont contented himself with making an exhibition of his force,
and causing it to execute a variety of manœuvres in our presence; and it
must be confessed, that a spectacle more striking has rarely been seen.
The large body of cavalry which followed us to our position, and had
bivouacked during the night in the woods adjoining, were first drawn up
in compact array, as if waiting for the signal to push on. By and by,
nine battalions of infantry, attended by a proportionate quantity of artillery,
made their appearance, and formed into columns, lines, echelons,
and squares. Towards noon, twelve battalions of the Imperial Guard
came upon the ground in one solid mass; and as each soldier was decked
out with feathers and shoulder-knots of a bloody hue, their appearance
was certainly imposing in no ordinary degree. The solid column, however,
soon deployed into columns of battalions—a movement which was
executed with a degree of quickness and accuracy quite admirable; and
then, after having performed several other evolutions with equal precision,
the Guards piled their arms, and prepared to bivouac. Next came another
division of infantry in rear of the Guards, and then a fresh column
of cavalry, till it was computed that the enemy had collected on this single
point a force of not less than twenty-five thousand men. Nor did the
muster cease to go on as long as daylight lasted. To the very latest
moment we could observe men, horses, guns, carriages, tumbrils, and
ammunition-waggons, flocking into the encampment; as if it were the
design of the French general to bring his whole disposable force to bear
against the position of Fuente Guinaldo.”—<i>Lord Londonderry.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> “The French batteries opened at daylight on the 28th June, and by
ten o’clock a practicable breach was formed: the besiegers then appeared
perfectly quiet, firing only an occasional round or two; but when the heat
of the day was a little past, they suddenly rushed to the assault. The
defenders made but a slight resistance, and in a few minutes the French
columns were in the streets, and immediately gave loose to every species
of licentiousness. Some thousands of the citizens perished by individual
atrocity; whilst a continued fire from the batteries swept away crowds of
trembling fugitives, who fled to the sea-side and sought refuge in the
boats of the squadron. The British seamen gallantly rescued many within
reach of the very sabres of the enemy’s dragoons, who charged amongst
the defenceless mass, cutting and slashing in every direction. In a word
it was a French army licensed to pursue its own inclinations; and scenes
such as are read with distrust in the ancient historians, are attested by
some thousand witnesses yet alive to have been acted here.”—<i>Jones’s
Account of the War.</i>
</p>
<p>
General Suchet’s own statement is as follows: “The rage of the soldiers
was increased by the obstinacy of the garrison, who expected to be
relieved, and who were prepared to sally out. The fiftieth assault made
yesterday in the middle of the day to the inner works was followed by a
frightful massacre, with little loss on our side. The terrible example,
which I foresaw with regret in my last report to your Highness, has taken
place, and will be long remembered in Spain. Four thousand men were
killed in the streets; ten or twelve thousand attempted to save themselves
by getting over the walls, a thousand of whom were sabred or drowned;
we have made 10,000 prisoners, including 500 officers, and in the hospitals
remain 1,500 wounded, whose lives have been spared.”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_155" href="#FNanchor_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The beautiful artillery practice at this siege was attributed to an accidental
circumstance,—the shot brought from Almeida to the batteries,
being of a larger size than that which is commonly employed; consequently
the windage was diminished, and the firing became so singularly
correct, that every shot struck the wall with a precision which ordinary
bullets, discharged from the same gun and with equal care, could not
effect.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> General Craufurd entered the army at an early age, and had seen
much and varied service. In the short interval of peace, he visited the
Continent to improve himself in the scientific branches of his profession,
and afterwards served in two Indian campaigns under Lord Cornwallis.
After some unimportant employments on the Continent, he joined the
disgraceful expedition against Buenos Ayres, and subsequently served
with the army of Sir John Moore, in command of the light brigade.
After the retreat, he joined Sir Arthur Wellesley the morning after Talavera,
and became most deservedly a favourite of that commander.
</p>
<p>
Craufurd’s military talents are admitted to have been of the first order.
An enthusiast regarding martial glory, he sought every opportunity to distinguish
himself. In the affair of the Coa—at Busaco and Fuentes
d’Onoro, he established an undying reputation. Wellington’s despatch
contained his well-earned eulogy—and the breach before which he fell
was fitly chosen as a last resting-place for the fearless leader of the gallant
light brigade.
</p>
<p>
The following very able sketch of the respective dispositions and abilities
of Craufurd and Picton, places their characters in a striking light.
We agree with Colonel Napier, in awarding to Craufurd the possession of
higher military talents than Picton ever exhibited—and we are convinced,
had both lived, and both been employed in active service, that Craufurd
would have shewed himself the abler officer. To compare either to Wellington,
is nothing but egregious folly. Both undoubtedly were brave,
ready, and intelligent—but to name them with the master-spirit of the
age, is an act of very injudicious friendship.
</p>
<p>
“Picton and Craufurd were, however, not formed by nature to act
cordially together. The stern countenance, robust frame, saturnine complexion,
caustic speech, and austere demeanour of the first, promised
little sympathy with the short thick figure, dark flashing eyes, quick
movements, and fiery temper of the second; nor, indeed, did they often
meet without a quarrel. Nevertheless, they had many points of resemblance
in their characters and fortunes. Both were inclined to harshness,
and rigid in command; both prone to disobedience, yet exacting entire
submission from inferiors; and they were alike ambitious and craving of
glory. They both possessed decided military talents—were enterprising,
and intrepid; yet neither were remarkable for skill in handling troops
under fire. This, also, they had in common, they both, after distinguished
services, perished in arms fighting gallantly, and being celebrated
as generals of division while living, have since their death been injudiciously
spoken of as rivalling their great leader in war. That they were
officers of mark and pretension is unquestionable, and Craufurd more so
than Picton, because the latter never had a separate command, and his
opportunities were necessarily more circumscribed; but to compare either
to the Duke of Wellington, displays ignorance of the men, and of the art
they professed. If they had even comprehended the profound military
and political combinations he was conducting, the one would carefully
have avoided fighting on the Coa, and the other, far from refusing, would
have eagerly proffered his support.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_157" href="#FNanchor_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> General Mackinnon was the younger son of the chieftain of Clan
Mackinnon. He was born near Winchester, and commenced his military
education in France. At fifteen he entered the army, served three years
as lieutenant in the 43rd, raised an independent company, and exchanged
into the Coldstream Guards. In Ireland he was brigade-major to General
Nugent, and served at the Helder, in Egypt, and at Copenhagen. In
1809, he joined Sir Arthur Wellesley, was present at the passage of the
Douro, and had two horses killed at Talavera. At Busaco he received
thanks upon the field—and after some sharp affairs with the French rear-guard
during Massena’s retreat, led the last charge in person at Fuentes
d’Onoro, which left the British in undisputed possession of the field.
</p>
<p>
In Mackinnon’s character there was no trait wanting to form the perfect
soldier. To the highest intellectual endowments, he united, “a gentle
manner, with a dauntless soul.” Married to a woman worthy of a
brave man’s love, his passion for military glory had allowed him little
space to enjoy that quiet happiness that generally waits on wedded life.
His selected profession demanded the sacrifice—a command was offered—he
accepted it, and left a happy home. At last his health declined—a
change of air was recommended—he reluctantly consented to leave the
Peninsula for a season—and, for the last time, revisited England.
</p>
<p>
Walking one evening in the garden, his lady led him to a spot where,
with all a woman’s pride, she had planted a laurel to commemorate every
action in which her beloved one had been victorious. Mackinnon, deeply
affected, turned away, whispering, “Alas! love, the cypress will be the
next!”
</p>
<p>
No leader was ever more deeply regretted. The brigade immediately
under his command adored him; and those who survived the explosion,
dug a grave inside the breach, and there hastily entombed the body of
their gallant general. After the confusion ceased, the officers of the Coldstream
Guards raised his honoured remains, and interred them at Espeja
with military honours.
</p>
<p>
But this lamented chief found a mourner even in an enemy. During
Mackinnon’s earlier residence in France, Napoleon, then a military student
in Dauphine, formed an intimacy with the family of the deceased.
Consequently, he became a regular visitor at their chateau, and it would
appear, that in after-days of pride and power, he never forgot the hospitality
offered to him, when he was but a nameless cadet. At the peace of
Amiens he invited the family to visit France—and when he heard Mackinnon
named among those who had fallen at Ciudad Rodrigo, it is said
that Napoleon betrayed unwonted regret at the decease of a youthful
friend, who seemed to hold a place in earlier affections, before war and
conquest had “steeled his heart, and seared his brow.”</p></div>

to the relief of Badajoz, and the consequent retrogression of our divisions.
It began by informing his Excellency the Prince of Neufchatel,
that having succeeded, in conjunction with the Duke of Dalmatia, in
raising the siege of Badajoz, the writer had since directed his undivided
attention to the reorganization and re-establishment of discipline in the
army of Portugal. The system of requisitions, and the irregularity of
supply, had been carried, it was continued, to so great a height, that the
army was become little better than a rabble of banditti; nor could any
thing be attempted, with the slightest prospect of success, till the method
should be entirely changed, and the troops provided and paid in such a
manner as to render them both contented and manageable. To accomplish
this the marshal was then devising plans; and he earnestly pressed
for instructions and assistance from the Emperor in carrying them into
execution.

“In addition to this despatch from Marmont, a letter from General
Tresion, chief of the staff, was likewise intercepted; but it contained little

hand-to-hand encounter succeeded. The Irishmen, undaunted by
the superior number of their assailants, laid five or six of the gunners at

regiment scrambled up to the assistance of their gallant comrades—and
the remnant of the French gunners perished by their bayonets.

The following anecdote is descriptive of those personal affairs that the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i> attendant on the first entrance of a defended town so frequently
produces. The actor, since dead, was a personal and an attached friend
of the author.
</p>
<p>
“Each affray in the streets was conducted in the best manner the moment
would admit of, and decided more by personal valour than discipline,
and in some instances officers as well as privates had to combat with the
imperial troops. In one of those encounters, Lieutenant George Faris,
of the 88th, by an accident so likely to occur in an affair of this kind,
separated a little too far from a dozen or so of his regiment, found himself
opposed to a French soldier, who apparently was similarly placed: it
was a curious coincidence, and it would seem as if each felt that <em>he</em> individually
was the representative of the country to which he belonged; and
had the fate of the two nations hung upon the issue of the combat I am
about to describe, it could not have been more heroically contested. The
Frenchman fired at, and wounded Faris in the thigh, and made a desperate
push with his bayonet at his body, but Faris parried the thrust, and
the bayonet only lodged in his leg; he saw at a glance the peril of his
situation, and that nothing short of a miracle could save him; the odds
against him were too great, and if he continued a scientific fight, he must
inevitably be vanquished; he sprang forward, and seizing hold of the
Frenchman by the collar, a struggle of a most nervous kind took place;
in their mutual efforts to gain an advantage, they lost their caps, and as
they were men of nearly equal strength, it was doubtful what the issue
would be. They were so entangled with each other, their weapons were
of no avail, but Faris at length disengaged himself from the grasp which
held him, and he was able to use his sabre; he pushed the Frenchman
from him, and ere he could recover himself, he laid his head open nearly
to the chin; his sword-blade, a heavy, soft, ill-made Portuguese one, was
doubled up with the force of the blow, and retained some pieces of skull
and clotted hair! At this moment I reached the spot with about twenty
men, composed of different regiments, all being by this time mixed pell-mell
with each other. I ran up to Faris—he was nearly exhausted, but
he was safe. The French grenadier lay upon the pavement, while Faris,
though tottering from fatigue, held his sword firmly in his grasp, and it
was crimsoned to the very hilt.”—<i>Grattan.</i>

<p>
It is strange how the lighter occurrences of human life ridiculously
intermingle with its graver concerns. An officer with a shattered leg
crawled into the corner of a traverse to avoid the rush of friends and
foes, each equally fatal. Presently the contest changed from his neighbourhood,
and the adjacent streets were deserted.
</p>
<p>
An hour passed—none disturbed his melancholy rest—when a footstep
was heard, and an 88th man staggered round the corner with a bundle of
sundry articles he had managed to collect. Unable to get further, he
placed it beneath his head—fixed his bayonet—and lay down to sleep in
peace. In a few moments a Portuguese camp-follower peeped round the
corner, looked suspiciously about, substituted a truss of straw for the
bundle, and absconded with the plunder the drunken Ranger had, as he
imagined, so carefully secured.</p></div>

“The drums of the division beat a ruffle; the officers took their stations;
the bands played; the soldiers cheered; and, in less than half an
hour, the spot which, since the 17th of the preceding month, had been a
scene of the greatest excitement, was now a lone and deserted waste,
having no other occupants than disabled or dying officers and soldiers, or
the corpses of those that had fallen in the strife. The contrast was
indeed great, and of that cast that made the most unreflecting think, and
the reflecting feel. The sound of the drums died away; the division
was no longer visible, except by the glittering of their firelocks: at length

latter assertion, it need only be recalled to memory, that the various arbitrary
decrees which, in the arrogance of uncontrolled authority, he from
time to time issued, to cramp and confine the industry of the world, were
obeyed without a hostile movement. The powerful and the weak equally
yielded them a full though reluctant compliance: even Russia, doubly

deemed it prudent to submit; till at length the prosperity of her

apprehension of it, therefore, existed, to divert his attention from the
affairs of Spain; and the impartial historian, of whatever country he may

tones over a more brilliant, varied, or chivalrous audience. To describe
the variety of groups would be endless: the eye, wandering through the
expanse of building, could seldom rest twice on objects of similarity. All
the pomp of a great episcopal seat was displayed on the occasion. Contrasted
with the sombre dresses of the numerous officiating clergy, the
scarlet uniforms of the British were held in relief by the dark Spanish or
Portuguese costume. The Spanish peasant, in all the simplicity and
cleanliness of his dress, appeared by the mustached and fierce-looking

desired, availing himself of which, he fell upon them like a thunderbolt;
and the issue of the attack was as decided a rout upon the part of the
French, as was, perhaps, ever experienced by any army. Their broken
and discomfited masses, swept away before our victorious troops, were
precipitated upon the Tormes, in crossing which many were drowned.
Had it not been for the protection afforded them by the night immediately
coming on—for it was four in the evening before the action commenced—few
of them could have escaped. As it was, although prevented
following up the victory to the full extent, the trophies of the day were
two eagles, twelve pieces of cannon, and 10,000 prisoners.

“It has been said, how far with truth the editor is not aware, that the
Duke of Wellington has been heard to express himself to this effect,—‘that
if required to particularize any of the battles in which he commanded
for the purpose, that Salamanca is the one on which he would
be best contented to rest his reputation as a general.’ When we consider
the infinite skill with which, during the previous operations, he out-manœuvred
his opponents, rendering their superiority of numbers of no
avail, the eagle-eyed sagacity that saw the error of the French commander,
and the promptness and decision with which he turned it to his purpose,
ending, as it did, in the total discomfiture and rout of the enemy, it is by
no means improbable that such is his opinion, although it may never
have been so openly expressed. On comparing it even with the most
brilliant of his other victories, such, no doubt, will be the opinion of
most military men.

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_192" href="#FNanchor_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> Mr. Southey, alluding to the eagles taken at Salamanca, gravely observes:
“It is said that more than <em>ten</em> were captured, but that there
were men base enough to conceal them, and sell them to persons in
Salamanca, who deemed it good policy, as well as a profitable speculation,
to purchase them for the French.”

<p>
Nothing can exceed the absurdity of this statement. The capture of
so many trophies could not have been achieved without a correspondent
notoriety—and those who were fortunate enough to win them, knew that
the gallant deed would secure both honours and promotion. Is it probable,
that the daring spirit who rushed into the deadly <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i> and seized
the proud emblem of victory, would barter it, when won, for a paltry
consideration? It is indeed a sweeping slander on British soldiers, to
insinuate that out of <em>ten</em> brave and devoted men—for brave and devoted
they must have been to do that deed—eight were the sordid wretches
which Dr. Southey has depicted them.</p></div>

“I hope that you will be pleased with our battle, of which the despatch

every thing went on as it ought; and there never was an army so
beaten in so short a time. If we had had another hour or two of daylight,
not a man would have passed the Tormes; and, as it was, they would all
have been taken if —— had left the garrison in Alba de Tormes,
as I wished and desired; or having taken it away, as I believe, before he
was aware of my wishes, he had informed me that it was not there. If he
had, I should have marched in the night upon Alba, where I should have

“I took up the ground which you were to have taken during the siege
of Salamanca, only the left was thrown back on the heights; it being
unnecessary, under the circumstances, to cover the ford of Saint Martha.
We had a race for the large Arapiles, which is the more distant of the
two detached heights which you will recollect on the right of your position:
this race the French won, and they were too strong to be dislodged
without a general action. I knew that the French were to be joined by
the cavalry of the army of the North on the 22nd or 23rd, and that the
army of the Centre was likely to be in motion. Marmont ought to have
given me a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pont d’or</i>, and he would have made a handsome operation of
it. But, instead of that, after manœuvring all the morning in the usual
French style, nobody knew with what object, he at last pressed upon my
right in such a manner, at the same time without engaging, that he would
have either carried our Arapiles, or he would have confined us entirely to
our position. This was not to be endured, and we fell upon him, turning
his left flank; and I never saw an army receive such a beating. I had
desired the Spaniards to continue to occupy the castle of Alba de Tormes;
—— had evacuated it, I believe, before he knew my wishes;
and he was afraid to let me know that he had done so; and I did not
know it till I found no enemy at the fords of the Tormes. When I lost
sight of them in the dark, I marched upon Huerta and Encinas, and they
went by Alba. If I had known there had been no garrison in Alba, I
should have marched there, and should probably have had the whole.
Marmont, Clausel, Foy, Ferrey, and Bonnet, are wounded badly. Ferrey,
it is supposed, will die. Thomières is killed—many generals of brigade
killed or wounded. I need not express how much I regret the disorder
in your eyes since this action. I am in great hopes that our loss has not
been great. In two divisions, the third and fifth, it is about twelve hundred
men, including Portuguese. There are more in the fourth and
sixth; but there are many men who left the ranks with wounded officers
and soldiers, who are eating and drinking, and engaged in <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">regocijos</i> with
the inhabitants of Salamanca; I have sent, however, to have them all
turned out of the town. I hope that you receive benefit from the advice
of the oculists in London.

of Moorish and Roman antiquity. Among the former is the Alcazar,
once the palace of the Moorish kings, and afterwards of Ferdinand and
Isabella, but which since their days has been used as a state prison. This
building stands on a rock, rising some hundred feet above the river, which
winds round nearly three-fourths of its base, and is cut off from the
town on the remaining portion by a deep ditch and defences. The aqueduct,
said to have been built by Trajan, is to be seen at different points
between the town and Ildefonso, where the water is obtained; but the
most remarkable feature of this structure is the portion in the suburb of
the town, consisting of two rows of arches one above the other, nearly
two hundred in number, the whole being formed of large blocks of stone,
fitted into and supporting each other without cement, having thus withstood
the ravages of time for eighteen centuries.

San Ildefonso is a village fifty miles north of Madrid. Here is situated
the palace of La Granja, a favourite summer residence of the royal
family. The building and gardens, with the numerous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jets d’eau</i>, were
formed after the model of the palace and gardens of Versailles, by the
Bourbon dynasty on their accession to the throne of Spain. The palace
is situate at the bottom of the Sierra Nevada, an attached ridge of the
Guaderama, in a recess on the north side of the mountain, which rises to
a considerable height, covered with trees to its summit, and to the east
and west; thus sheltering it at all times from the scorching heats of
summer. The front of the building looks to the gardens, which rise
before it, till they terminate in the craggy, pine-covered summit, adding
much to the picturesque beauty of this delightful residence. The whole
presents a scene, certainly, much more calculated to remind the beholder
of the verdure and freshness of a more northern clime than of the burning
fields and sultry sun of Spain.</p></div>

the summit we commanded a boundless view of the country we had lately
traversed, interesting from being the scene of our past toils and victories;
while in our front lay one not less so from its novelty, from the many
striking objects that presented themselves to the eye; but, above all,
awaking feelings the most intensely interesting, from our near approach
upon the capital of Spain, a flying and dispirited enemy in our front.
With exhilarated spirits we descended the wooded skirts of the mountain,

artillery in the night. In this instance, the good order and silence with
which the allied army filed under the walls of the castle, was rendered of
no avail to them by the conduct of a party of guerilla cavalry, who, unused
to such coolness, put their horses to their speed, and made such a clatter
that the garrison took the alarm, and opened a fire from the artillery
directed on the bridge: the first discharge was, as might have been

he reached the edge of the chasm made by the explosion, and then violently
checking his foaming horse, held up his hands, exclaiming that he was a
lost man, and with hurried accents asked if there was no ford near. The
good-natured soldiers pointed to one a little way off, and the gallant fellow
having looked earnestly for a few moments as if to fix the exact point,
wheeled his horse round, kissed his hand in derision, and bending over

the divisions by another road, longer, and apparently more difficult; this
seemed such an extraordinary proceeding to some general officers, that,
after consulting together, they deemed their commander unfit to conduct
the army, and led their troops by what appeared to them the fittest line
of retreat! Meanwhile, Wellington, who had, before daylight, placed
himself at an important point on his own road, waited impatiently for the
arrival of the leading division until dawn, and then suspecting something
of what had happened, galloped to the other road, and found the would-be
commanders stopped by that flood which his arrangements had been
made to avoid. The insubordination and the danger to the whole army
were alike glaring, yet the practical rebuke was so severe and well-timed,
the humiliation so complete, and so deeply felt, that, with one proud sarcastic
observation, indicating contempt more than anger, he led back the
troops and drew off all his forces safely. However, some confusion and
great danger still attended the operation; for even on this road one water-gully

Soult, unable to feed his troops a day longer, stopped on the Huebra
with his main body, and only sent some cavalry to Tamames. Thus the
allies retired unmolested.”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_213" href="#FNanchor_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> “It is scarcely possible to imagine what powerful effect the excitement
consequent on active warfare produces upon those who under different
circumstances would evince apathy or irritability. Men nursed in
the lap of luxury, and accustomed from childhood to all the elegancies of
upper life, submitted to every privation without a murmur; while others,
whose constitutional indolence was proverbial, seemed actuated by some
secret impulse that spurred them to exertion, and roused a latent energy
that was surprising even to themselves. Persons who at home would
have dreaded injurious circumstances from a damp shoe, were too happy,
on service in the Peninsula, to find the shelter of a roof and luxury of
wet litter after a ten hours’ march over muddy roads, in rain, and storm,
and darkness; and those whose Apician tastes were not unfrequently
outraged by the culinary offendings of the most gifted mess-cook, cheerfully
discussed the ration cut from the reeking carcass of an over-driven
ox, and exchanged claret and champaign for <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">aqua ardiente</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vin du
pays</i>, flavouring more strongly of the goat-skin than the grape.”
</p>
<p>
It is true, that when cantoned the army were spared from these annoyances.
The strict eye kept by Lord Wellington over the commissariat at
these times, secured a plentiful supply of necessaries for the troops, and
under huts or canvass they were tolerably protected from the weather;
but at the sieges, the retreats, and the rapid advances in bad weather,
nothing could surpass the misery endured through cold and heat, hunger
and thirst, continued fatigue, and all the ills the soldier’s life is heir to.
</p>
<p>
Bright as the hour of triumph appears to the conqueror—brilliant as
the foughten field that ends in victory—“the tale of war still bears a
painful sound,” and many a heart-rending story of distress might be
narrated attendant on the storms of Badajoz and Rodrigo, and the
retreats to Corunna and the Lines. The state of the sick, the worn-out,
and the wounded, were pitiable. Unable to extricate themselves, numbers,
“with vulnerable wounds,” perished of cold and hunger in the
ditches of the captured fortresses—or, after struggling to the last, died on
the line of march, abandoned of necessity by their comrades, and ridden
over or put down by merciless pursuers, who had neither leisure nor
inclination to extend succour to these deserted sufferers.
</p>
<p>
In speaking of the retreat from Burgos, an infantry officer says,—“The
privations which the army suffered were unusually severe: I saw
many a brave fellow lying on the road, dying from fatigue, famine, and
the inclemency of the weather. On one spot, about one hundred English
and Portuguese soldiers lay extended after the retreat. One miserable
instance, was a soldier of the ninety-fifth; having marched as far as
he was able, at last he sunk from exhaustion, and crawled upon his hands
and knees, until he expired.”
</p>
<p>
Another thus describes his misadventure. “We travelled the whole of
that night, our army in full retreat, and the French in close pursuit; the
weather wet and miserably cold, and the roads so drenched, it was up to
the middle in mud; the animals were knocked up, and I unfortunately
fell into the hands of the enemy, a French hussar regiment, who treated
me vilely.
</p>
<p>
“They knocked the cart from under me, sabred the men, and dragged
me into the middle of the road; stripped me, tearing my clothes into
shreds, and turning me over with their sabres, plundered me of what little
I had remaining; tore a gold ring from my finger, and then left me
naked, to perish with cold and hunger.
</p>
<p>
“I lay in this miserable state two days and nights, with no mortal
near me, except dead ones; one of which lay with his head upon my legs,
having died in that position during the night preceding, and I was too
weak to remove his body; I could not raise myself, I was so reduced.
</p>
<p>
“In this suffering state I continued to exist, which I attributed to
some rum, of which I drank a considerable quantity from a Frenchman’s
canteen, who was humane enough to let me do so, when I explained to
him that I was a British officer: the rum soon laid me to sleep. The
Frenchman was a hussar, and appeared to belong to the regiment who
had treated me so inhumanly in the morning (it was now past dusk). I
begged him to take me up behind him. He shook his head; but kindly
took an old blanket from under his saddle, covered me with it, and then
rode off.”
</p>
<p>
In this wretched state the narrator was discovered by an Irish soldier
who turned out a true Samaritan.
</p>
<p>
“The poor fellow found me literally in a state of starvation, and took
me upon his back (for I was quite helpless) to the village; begged food
for me from door to door; but the inhuman Spaniards shut them in our
faces, refusing me both shelter and food, at the same time they were
actually baking bread for the French. However, my fellow-sufferer, by
good chance, found a dead horse, and he supplied me with raw flesh and
acorns; which, at the time, I thought a luxury, believe me, and devoured,
when first given me, in such quantities, as nearly put an end to my sufferings.”
</p>
<p>
A very creditable exception must be made in favour of the Spanish
women, who, during the Peninsular campaign, exhibited the greatest
kindness towards the British, and afforded to the sick or wounded soldiery
the most disinterested and devoted attention. In the higher classes this
feeling was frequently indulged, even at the risk of family or personal
proscription; and it would appear that among the humbler grade a warm
sympathy existed towards their deliverers. “Two girls, daughters of the
baker of the village, notwithstanding the threat of punishment to those
who should relieve me, absolutely did, two or three times, bring me a
little food saved from their own meals.”—<i>Military Recollections of Four
Brothers.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_214" href="#FNanchor_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> “The Spaniards, civil and military, began to evince hatred of the
British. Daily did they attempt or perpetrate murder; and one act of
peculiar atrocity merits notice. A horse, led by an English soldier, being
frightened, backed against a Spanish officer commanding at a gate; he
caused the soldier to be dragged into his guard-house and there bayonetted
him in cold blood; and no redress could be had for this or other crimes
save by counter violence, which was not long withheld. A Spanish officer,
while wantonly stabbing at a rifleman, was shot dead by the latter; and a
British volunteer slew a Spanish officer at the head of his own regiment
in a sword fight, the troops of both nations looking on; but here there
was nothing dishonourable on either side.”—<i>Napier.</i>
</p>
<p>
“Two of the handsomest men of the light company, M’Cann and Ludley,
were billeted in a house containing a mother and her daughter, when
one evening a Spaniard came in and invited them to take some wine with
him, during which, it is supposed, in a fit of jealousy, he took the opportunity
of stabbing them both to the heart. The assassin made his escape
before the alarm could be given, as also did the mother and daughter;
but our men were so exasperated, that they attacked the house, and in
twenty minutes there was not one stone left upon another.”—<i>Cadell.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_215" href="#FNanchor_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> “Sir,—I have ordered the army into cantonments, in which I hope
that circumstances will enable me to keep them for some time, during
which the troops will receive their clothing, necessaries, &amp;c. which are
already in progress, by different lines of communication, to the several
divisions and brigades. But, besides these objects, I must draw your
attention, in a very particular manner, to the state of discipline of the
troops. The discipline of every army, after a long and active campaign,
becomes in some degree relaxed, and requires the utmost attention on the
part of the general and other officers to bring it back to the state in
which it ought to be for service; but I am concerned to have to observe,
that the army under my command has fallen off, in this respect, in the
late campaign, to a greater degree than any army with which I have ever
served, or of which I have ever read. Yet this army has met with no disaster;
it has suffered no privations, which but trifling attention on the
part of the officers could not have prevented, and for which there existed
no reason whatever in the nature of the service; nor has it suffered any
hardships, excepting those resulting from the necessity of being exposed
to the inclemencies of the weather, at a moment when they were most
severe. It must be obvious, however, to every officer, that from the
moment the troops commenced their retreat from the neighbourhood of
Burgos on the one hand, and from Madrid on the other, the officers lost
all command over the men. Irregularities and outrages of all descriptions
were committed with impunity; and losses have been sustained
which ought never to have occurred. Yet the necessity for retreat existing,
none was ever made in which the troops made such short marches;
none on which they made such long and repeated halts; and none in
which the retreating armies were so little pressed on their rear by the
enemy. We must look, therefore, for the existing evils, and for the
situation in which we now find the army, to some cause besides those
resulting from the operations in which we have been engaged. I have
no hesitation in attributing these evils to the habitual inattention of the
officers of regiments to their duty, as prescribed by the standing regulations
of the service, and by the order of this army. I am far from questioning
the zeal, still less the gallantry and spirit of the officers of the
army: and I am quite certain, that as their minds can be convinced of
the necessity of minute and constant attention to understand, recollect,
and carry into execution the orders which have been issued for the performance
of their duty, and that the strict performance of this duty is
necessary to enable the army to serve the country as it ought to be served,
they will, in future, give their attention to these points. Unfortunately,
the inexperience of the officers of the army has induced many to conceive,
that the period during which an army is not on service is one of relaxation
from all rule, instead of being, as it is, the period during which, of
all others, every rule for the regulation and control of the conduct of the
soldier, for the inspection and care of his arms, ammunition, accoutrements,
necessaries, and field-equipments, and his horse and horse-appointments,
for the receipt and issue and care of his provisions, and the
regulation of all that belongs to his food, and the forage for his horse,
must be most strictly attended to by the officers of his company or troop,
if it is intended that an army—a British army in particular—shall be
brought into the field of battle in a state of efficiency to meet the enemy
on the day of trial. These are the points, then, to which I most earnestly
entreat you to turn your attention, and the attention of the officers of the
regiments under your command, Portuguese as well as English, during
the period in which it may be in my power to leave the troops in their
cantonments. The commanding officers of regiments must enforce the
orders of the army, regarding the constant inspection and superintendence
of the officers over the conduct of the men of their companies in their
cantonments; and they must endeavour to inspire the non-commissioned
officers with a sense of their situation and authority; and the non-commissioned
officers must be forced to do their duty, by being constantly
under the view and superintendence of the officers. By these means, the
frequent and discreditable recourse to the authority of the provost, and
to punishments by the sentence of courts-martial, will be prevented; and
the soldiers will not dare to commit the offences and outrages, of which
there are too many complaints, when they know that their officers and
their non-commissioned officers have their eyes and attention turned
towards them. The commanding officers of regiments must likewise
enforce the orders of the army, regarding the constant real inspection of
the soldiers’ arms, ammunition, accoutrements, and necessaries, in order
to prevent, at all times, the shameful waste of ammunition, and the sale
of that article, and of the soldiers’ necessaries. With this view, both
should be inspected daily. In regard to the food of soldiers, I have frequently
observed and lamented, in the late campaign, the facility and
celerity with which the French soldiers cooked, in comparison with our
army. The cause of this disadvantage is the same with that of every other
description,—the want of attention of the officers to the orders of the
army, and to the conduct of their men; and the consequent want of
authority over their conduct. Certain men of each company should be
appointed to cut and bring in wood, others to fetch water, and others to
get the meat, &amp;c. to be cooked; and it would soon be found, if this practice
were daily enforced, and a particular hour for seeing the dinners, and
for the men dining, named, as it ought to be, equally as for the parade,
that cooking would no longer require the inconvenient length of time it
has lately been found to take, and that the soldiers would not be exposed
to the privation of their food, at the moment at which the army may be
engaged in operations with the enemy. You will, of course, give your
attention to the field-exercise and discipline of the troops. It is very
desirable that the soldiers should not lose the habit of marching; and the
division should march ten or twelve miles twice in each week, if the weather
should permit, and the roads in the neighbourhood of the cantonments
of the divisions should be dry. But I repeat, that the great object
of the attention of the general and field officers must be, to get the captains
and subalterns of the regiments to understand and to perform the
duties required from them, as the only mode by which the discipline and
efficiency of the army can be restored and maintained during the next
campaign.

with cold, waiting the order to move. Their clothes were seldom
dry for six hours together, and during the latter part of the retreat continually
wet; sometimes they were bivouacked in a swamp, when better
ground was near; they lay down upon the wet ground, fell asleep from
mere exhaustion, were roused to receive their meat, and had then no
means of dressing it,—the camp-kettles had been sent on, or by some
error were some miles in the rear, or the mules which carried them had
foundered on the way; and no fire could be kindled on wet ground, with

sooner than was intended, the destruction which was intended for their
enemies, fell in part upon themselves. Many of their men, who were
lingering to plunder, perished as they were loading their horses with
booty in the streets and squares, and three or four hundred were blown
up in the fort. Above one thousand shells had been placed in the mines:
the explosion was distinctly heard at the distance of fifty miles; and the
pavement of the cathedral was covered with the dust into which its windows
had been shivered by the shock. The town escaped destruction
owing to the failure of so many of the mines, but the castle was totally
destroyed,—gates, beams, masses of masonry, guns, carriages, and arms
lying in one heap of ruins;—some of the mines had laid open the

victory gained by Leuvigildus XVI., king of the Goths, over the Swevians,
whose kingdom he conquered and added to his own, so early as towards the
end of the sixth century. Its vicinity, however, having been the scene of
the successful operations of Edward the Black Prince, in restoring to his
dominions Don Pedro the Cruel, king of Castile, this will, it is hoped, be
sufficient to justify the allusion to the name as twice associated with the
glory of the English arms.
</p>
<p>
“The battle which overthrew Henry and restored Pedro to his kingdom,
was fought betwixt Navarette and Nejara, on the right bank of the
Ebro; but Froissart, in his Chronicles, mentions that before the Prince
had crossed that river, he occupied for six days a position in front of
Vitoria, probably near the scene of Wellington’s victory. He further
mentions, that while in this position, Don Telo, Henry’s brother, having
advanced to reconnoitre the Prince’s army, fell in with a body of English
under Sir Thomas Felton, who, being much inferior in numbers, in the
proportion of one hundred and sixty lances and three hundred archers to
six thousand of the enemy, took possession of a height, where they defended
themselves till the whole of the English knights, after performing prodigies
of valour, were killed or made prisoners, none escaping, except a few
boys by the fleetness of their horses.
</p>
<p>
“It may be mentioned as a curious incident, that during the battle,
when Lord Wellington was giving directions for the third division to
attack a height in possession of the enemy, the Spanish General Alava,
who during the war was personally attached to Lord Wellington’s staff,
remarked that the hill in question was, by the tradition of the country,
known as the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Altura de los Ingleses</i> or Hill of the English: this is supposed

Joseph’s defeat reached Napoleon at a crisis, when a lost battle was a
calamity indeed. With him, every previous armistice had obtained concessions;
and, had Vitoria terminated differently, battles, in no way
decisive, might from a fortunate success in Spain, have produced results
similar to those of Marengo, Austerlitz, and Jena. With ominous
rapidity, the intelligence reached every European court that Joseph had
been driven from his throne, and Wellington overlooked the fields of
France—and none could gainsay it—a conqueror. With what astonishment
these tidings were received, those immediately round the person of
Napoleon have since narrated. Nothing could be more humiliating—nothing,
the time considered, more ruinous. His brother no longer
prosecuted the war in Spain, but, defeated and shaken in confidence, had
sought shelter in the plains of Gascony. “Accustomed as he had been
to receive reports from the Peninsula little calculated to give satisfaction,
or to confirm his impression of the invincible qualities of those troops
which he had personally ever led to certain victory, so extensive and
alarming a reverse as that now made known must have been as unexpected
as it was disastrous; but with all the promptitude of a person born to
command, instead of yielding to gloomy circumstances, he issued orders
for a bold effort to counteract the tide of war, to recover the ground lost
by Vitoria, and to awaken to energy, as he conceived, the dormant spirit
of his soldiers. Troops marched from the interior to reinforce, artillery
from the depôts completed the equipment, and the marshal Duke of
Dalmatia was entrusted with full powers to conduct the renewed hostilities,
and retrieve the errors of his predecessors.”—<i>Leith Hay.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_234" href="#FNanchor_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> In fact, the picket was surprised—the advanced videts upon a height
in its front having been overpowered by the heat, had fallen asleep, and
thus allowed the French to approach the picket without giving an alarm.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_235" href="#FNanchor_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> “The French gained ground until six o’clock, for the British, shrunk
in numbers, also wanted ammunition, and a part of the 82nd, under
Major Fitzgerald, were forced to roll down stones to defend the rocks on
which they were posted. In this desperate condition Stewart was upon
the point of abandoning the mountain entirely, when a brigade of the 7th
division, commanded by General Barnes, arrived from Echallar, and that
officer, charging at the head of the sixth regiment, drove the French back
to the Maya ridge.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_236" href="#FNanchor_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Riding at full speed, he reached the village of Sorauren, and his
eagle-glance detected Clausel’s column in march along the ridge of
Zabaldica. Convinced that the troops in the valley of the Lanz must be
intercepted by this movement, he sprang from his saddle, and pencilled a
note on the parapet of the bridge, directing the troops to take the road to
Oricain, and gain the rear of Cole’s position. The scene that followed
was highly interesting. “Lord Fitzroy Somerset, the only staff-officer
who had kept up with him, galloped with these orders out of Sorauren by
one road, the French light cavalry dashed in by another, and the English
general rode alone up the mountain to reach his troops. One of
Campbell’s Portuguese battalions first descried him, and raised a cry of
joy, and the shrill clamour caught up by the next regiments swelled as it
run along the line into that stern and appalling shout which the British
soldier is wont to give upon the edge of battle, and which no enemy ever
heard unmoved. Lord Wellington suddenly stopped in a conspicuous
place; he desired that both armies should know he was there; and a
double spy who was present pointed out Soult, then so near that his features
could be plainly distinguished. The English general, it is said,
fixed his eyes attentively upon this formidable man, and speaking as if to
himself, said, ‘<em>Yonder is a great commander, but he is a cautious one,
and will delay his attack to ascertain the cause of these cheers; that
will give time for the 6th division to arrive, and I shall beat him</em>.’ And
certain it is that the French general made no serious attack that day.”—<i>Napier.</i>

Twelve British regiments were embattled on the Pyrenees who had
fought at Talavera; and there were present not a few who might recall an
incident to memory, that would present a striking but amusing contrast
Cuesta, examining his battle-ground four years before in lumbering state,
seated in an unwieldly coach, and drawn by eight pampered mules;
Wellington, on an English hunter, dashing from post to post at headlong
speed, and at a pace that distanced the best mounted of his staff.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_237" href="#FNanchor_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> “On the 31st of July, Soult continued retreating, while five British
divisions pressed the pursuit vigorously by Roncesvalles, Mayo, and
Donna Maria. Nothing could equal the distress of the enemy,—they
were completely worn down; and, fatigued and disheartened as they were,
the only wonder is, that multitudes did not perish in the wild and rugged
passes through which they were obliged to retire. Although rather in the
rear of some of the columns, the British light brigades were ordered forward
to overtake the enemy; and, wherever they came up, bring them to
immediate action. At midnight the bivouacs were abandoned,—the division
marched,—and, after nineteen hours’ continued exertions, during
which time a distance of nearly forty miles was traversed, over Alpine
heights and roads rugged and difficult beyond description, the enemy were
overtaken and attacked. A short, but smart affair, ensued. To extricate
the tail of the column, and enable the wounded to get away, the French
threw a portion of their rear-guard across the river. The rifles instantly
attacked the reinforcement,—a general fusilade commenced, and continued
until night put an end to the affair, when the enemy retreated over the
bridge of Yanzi, and the British pickets took possession of it. Both sides
lost many men, and a large portion of French baggage fell into the hands
of the pursuing force, who had moved by St. Estevan.
</p>
<p>
“That night the British light troops lay upon the ground; and next
morning moved forward at daybreak. Debouching through the pass at
Vera, the hill of Santa Barbara was crossed by the second brigade, while
the rifles carried the heights of Echalar, which the French voltigeurs
seemed determined to maintain. As the mountain was obscured by
a thick fog, the firing had a strange appearance to those who witnessed it
from the valley, occasional flashes only being seen, while every shot was
repeated by a hundred echoes. At twilight the enemy’s light infantry
were driven in; but long after darkness fell, the report of musketry continued;
until, after a few spattering shots, a death-like silence succeeded,
and told that the last of the enemy had followed their companions, and
abandoned the heights to their assailants.”—<i>The Bivouac.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_238" href="#FNanchor_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> “The enemy had no success on any other ground, and were terribly
beat after I joined the troops at Sorauren. Their loss cannot be less than
15,000 men, and I am not certain that it is not 20,000 men. We have
about 4,000 prisoners. I never saw such fighting as on the 27th and 28th
of July, the anniversary of the battle of Talavera, nor such determination
as the troops showed.

day till the 2nd. The battle of the 28th was fair <em>bludgeon</em> work. The
4th division was principally engaged; and the loss of the enemy was immense.
Our loss has likewise been very severe, but not of a nature to
cripple us.”—<i>Letter to Lord William Bentinck, Lisaca, 5th August,

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_239" href="#FNanchor_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> On the night of the 28th, Soult took the precaution of sending his

have been added to the immense parc already captured from Joseph at

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_240" href="#FNanchor_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> “The peculiarity of the prospect was heightened by a long train of
Spaniards, carrying officers and soldiers to the rear, who had been
wounded in the late engagements, and who were always removed to proper
hospitals as soon as it could be done with safety.
</p>
<p>
“The care of the sick and wounded necessarily employed a number of
men; and they could nowhere receive such able attention as in the general
hospitals established within the Spanish frontiers.
</p>
<p>
“The rugged mountain-road was not passable for spring-waggons, on
which the wounded are usually conveyed to the rear, and they were therefore
carried in blankets fastened at the sides to a couple of poles, and thus
borne on the shoulders of the peasantry.
</p>
<p>
“This mode of conveyance on bad roads is far preferable to that of
spring-waggons; but, as it required four men to carry one sick person, the
transport of the small number of them gave the train a formidable appearance
when seen extended for so great a length along the windings of the
mountain track.”—<i>Batty.</i></p></div>

<p>
In a tempest of thunder, lightning, and rain, and amid the uproar of

“The town presented a dreadful spectacle both of the work of war and
of the wickedness which in war is let loose.
</p>
<p>
“It had caught fire during the assault, owing to the quantity of combustibles
of all kinds which were scattered about. The French rolled their
shells into it, from the castle, and while it was in flames the troops were
plundering, and the people of the surrounding country flocking to profit
by the spoils of their countrymen.
</p>
<p>
“The few inhabitants who were to be seen seemed stupified with horror,—they
had suffered so much, that they looked with apathy at all around
them, and when the crash of a falling house made the captors run, they
scarcely moved.
</p>
<p>
“Heaps of dead were lying everywhere, English, Portuguese, and
French, one upon another; with such determination had the one side
attacked and the other maintained its ground.
</p>
<p>
“Very many of the assailants lay dead on the roofs of the houses which
adjoined the breach. The bodies were thrown into the mines and other
excavations, and there covered over so as to be out of sight, but so hastily
and slightly, that the air far and near was tainted, and fires were kindled
in the breaches to consume those which could not be otherwise disposed
of.

“The hospital presented a more dreadful scene, for it was a scene of
human suffering: friend and enemy had been indiscriminately carried thither,
and were there alike neglected. On the third day after the assault,
many of them had received neither surgical assistance nor food of any kind,
and it became necessary to remove them on the fifth, when the flames
approached the building. Much of this neglect would have been unavoidable,
even if that humane and conscientious diligence which can be hoped
for from so few, had been found in every individual belonging to the medical
department, the number of the wounded being so great; and little help
could be received from the other part of the army, because it had been
engaged in action on the same day.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_248" href="#FNanchor_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> San Sebastian was won. Would that its horrors had ended with its
storm! but the scenes that followed were terrible. The sky became suddenly
overcast—thunder was heard above the din of battle—and mortal
fury mingled with an elemental uproar. Darkness came on; but houses
wrapped in flames directed the licentious soldiery to plunder, and acts of
violence still more horrible. The storms of Badajoz and Rodrigo were
followed by the most revolting excesses; yet they fell infinitely short of
those committed after San Sebastian was carried by assault. “Some order
was first maintained, but the resolution of the troops to throw off discipline
was quickly made manifest. A British staff officer was pursued with a
volley of small arms, and escaped with difficulty from men who mistook
him for the provost-martial of the 5th division; a Portuguese adjutant,
who endeavoured to prevent some atrocity, was put to death in the market-place,
not with sudden violence from a single ruffian, but deliberately by a
number of English soldiers. Many officers exerted themselves to preserve
order: many men were well-conducted, but the rapine and violence commenced
by villains soon spread, the camp-followers crowded into the
place, and the disorder continued, until the flames following the steps of
the plunderer put an end to his ferocity by destroying the whole town.”
</p>
<p>
“This storm seemed to be the signal of hell for the perpetration of
villany which would have shamed the most ferocious barbarians of antiquity.
At Ciudad Rodrigo intoxication and plunder had been the principal
object; at Badajoz lust and murder were joined to rapine and drunkenness;
but at San Sebastian, the direst, the most revolting cruelty was
added to the catalogue of crimes. One atrocity, of which a girl of seventeen
was the victim, staggers the mind by its enormous, incredible, indescribable
barbarity.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

shall get the place, against ourselves, and the convenience we should derive
from having the houses of the place in a perfect state of repair. If —— intended
to use his mortars and howitzers against any particular
work occupied by the enemy, such as the cavalier, their use would answer
his purpose. If he knew exactly where the enemy’s intrenchment was
situated, their use <em>might</em> answer his purpose. I say <em>might</em>, because
I recollect that, at the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, our trenches were bombarded
by eleven or thirteen large mortars and howitzers for ten days, in
which time thirteen thousand shells were thrown, which occasioned us but
little loss, notwithstanding that our trenches were always full, and, I may

The commandant of the place had been uniformly attentive to the officers

said that he had been twice a prisoner in England; that he had been fifty
years in the service, and on the 15th of the passing month he should have
received his dismission; he was now sixty-six, he said, an old man, and
should never serve again; and if he might be permitted to retire into
France, instead of being sent into England, he should be the happiest
of men. Sir Thomas Graham wrote to Lord Wellington in favour of the
kind-hearted old man, and it may be believed that the application was not
made in vain.

them, by the fusees in their rotatory motion. Instead of passing

The old general dropped his sword in return to the civilities of the British
officers, and leading the remains of his brave battalions to the glacis, there
deposited their arms, with a well-founded confidence of having nobly done

strike at the Duque del Parque, or to get the assistance of Harispe, whom
he had left opposed to the Duque del Parque. I know that in his first
proclamation to his army on their success, he knew so little what had
passed at Tarragona, that he mentioned the English General having raised

perhaps, in all Europe, uniting, in a remarkable degree, the various characters
of the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque. At every bend
of the river, the road along its banks brings us suddenly on some new and
striking feature. The pleasing combination of wood and rock, overhanging
the beautifully winding stream, contrasted with the barren grandeur of
the mountain summits which tower above them, present an infinite number
of delightful prospects. The oak, the chestnut, and the walnut are
the most conspicuous trees along the valley and the slopes of the inferior
hills; whilst among the crevices of the rocks, the evergreen box-tree
grows with surprising luxuriance, and by its deep verdure relieves, while
it contrasts in a very beautiful manner, the bright silver tints of the surrounding
rocks, clothed with lichens.

“A small chapel stands on this hill, and the French fortified it, and
continued the line of intrenchments from thence to the sea. The most
vulnerable points of the enemy’s position, if any might be called so on this
part of his line, were strengthened by abbatis; and as the country was well
wooded, and had numerous orchards, these defences were multiplied upon
every part of his line. The cutting down of whole rows of orchard-trees
was a serious evil to the unfortunate inhabitants, who, however, had almost
to a man fled the country.
</p>
<p>
“The buildings, though thinly scattered over the country, are picturesque,
and, like most of the Spanish houses, have large projecting
roofs. Glazed windows are rarely seen, shutters being almost everywhere
the substitute. There are but few vineyards in this vicinity, excepting on
the slopes of Jaysquibel, near Fontarabia, but about the houses the vine is
everywhere reared. The inhabitants are a strong and well-proportioned
race, having jet-black hair, black eyes, and deep brown complexions.
The women, many of them tall and with handsome features, wear their
hair in a huge plait, which hangs down the back below the waist; but neither
sex were observed to have those “ears of uncommon size” which
Buffon says Nature has given to the inhabitants of the banks of the

to go forward, “there happened to be present an officer of the 43rd regiment,
named Haverlock, who being attached to General Alten’s staff, was
sent to ascertain Giron’s progress. His fiery temper could not brook the
check. He took off his hat, he called upon the Spaniards to follow him,
and putting spurs to his horse, at one bound cleared the abbatis and went
headlong amongst the enemy. Then the soldiers, shouting for ‘<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">El chico
blanco</i>,’ <em>the fair boy</em>,—so they called him, for he was very young and
had light hair—with one shock broke through the French, and this at the

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_257" href="#FNanchor_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> In October, the garrison were put upon an allowance of four ounces
of horseflesh each man. In a week that too failed; every domestic animal
had been consumed; rats were eagerly sought for, and weeds supplied the
place of vegetables. A feeble sally was made upon the 10th, but it was
repulsed with a loss of eighty men. Disease generally accompanies
famine—scurvy broke out—a thousand men were reported to be in the
hospital, as many were wounded, and death and desertion had lessened the
garrison by six hundred. In these desperate circumstances, Cassan, the
governor, sent out to offer a surrender, provided he was allowed to retire
into France with six pieces of artillery. A peremptory rejection of this
condition was followed by a proposition that the soldiers should not serve
for a year. This, too, being refused, it was intimated to the Spanish
general, that after blowing up the works, Cassan would imitate Brennier,
and trust to fortune and gallantry for the deliverance of his exhausted
garrison. This proceeding on the part of the French governor was so
repugnant to the rules of war, that a letter was conveyed to his advanced
post, denouncing the attempt as inhuman, involving in a desperate experiment
the destruction of unfortunate beings who had already borne the
horrors of a siege, with an assurance that, should it be attempted, the
governor and officers would be shot, and the private soldiers decimated.
Most probably the threat of mining the city had been merely used to
obtain more favourable terms, and neither the abominable experiment was
made, nor the terrible retaliation which would have followed was required.
On the 31st the garrison surrendered, and the finest fortress on the
Peninsula became thus a bloodless conquest.</p></div>

to reach the place of slaughter—for the roads along which they had been
driven might easily be traced by their numerous carcasses, lying half-buried
or unburied by the way-side—sad proofs of the wasteful inhumanity
of war! The weather had been more stormy than was usual even
on that coast and at that season. The transports at Passages were moored
stem and stem in rows, and strongly confined by their moorings; yet they
were considered in danger even in that land-locked harbour: some were
driven forward by the rising of the swell, while others, close alongside,
were forced backwards by its fall, so that the bowsprits of some were
entangled in the mizen-chains of others. The cold on the mountains was
so intense, that several men perished. A picket in the neighbourhood of
Roncesvalles was snowed up: the parties who were sent to rescue it drove
bullocks before them as some precaution against the danger of falling into
chasms, and the men were brought off; but the guns could not be

“Mountain guns on swivel carriages, harnessed on the backs of mules
purposely trained for that service, ascended the rugged ridges of the mountains,

astonished the French, the artillerymen dragging the guns with ropes up
steep precipices, or lowering them down to positions from whence they
could with more certain aim pour forth their fatal volleys against the
enemy.”—<i>Batty.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_260" href="#FNanchor_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> During the short term of inaction which the inclemency of the weather
had occasioned, one of those periods of conventional civility which
not unfrequently occurred during the Peninsular campaigns, took place
between the French and allied outposts. “A disposition,” says Quartermaster
Surtees, “had for some time been gaining ground with both armies,
to mitigate the miseries of warfare, as much as was consistent with each
doing their duty to their country; and it had by this time proceeded to such
an extent, as to allow us to place that confidence in them that they would
not molest us, even if we passed their outposts.”
</p>
<p>
Lord Wellington, however, discountenanced those friendly relations,
where the arrangements were so perfectly amicable, that the parties not
only took charge of love letters, but even “plundered in perfect harmony.”
</p>
<p>
“Before this order was issued, the most unbounded confidence subsisted
between us, and which it was a pity to put a stop to, except for such
weighty reasons. They used to get us such things as we wanted from
Bayonne, particularly brandy, which was cheap and plentiful; and we in
return gave them occasionally a little tea, of which some of them had
learned to be fond. Some of them also, who had been prisoners of war in
England, sent letters through our army-post to their sweethearts in England,
our people receiving the letters and forwarding them.”
</p>
<p>
“The next day, there being no firing between us and those in our
front, three French officers, seemingly anxious to prove how far politeness
and good breeding could be carried between the two nations, when war
did not compel them to be unfriendly, took a table and some chairs out of
a house which was immediately in our front, and one which we had lately
occupied as a barrack; and bringing them down into the middle of the
field which separated the advance of the two armies, sat down within a hundred
yards of our picket, and drank wine, holding up their glasses, as much
as to say, ‘Your health,’ every time they drank. Of course we did not
molest them, but allowed them to have their frolic out.
</p>
<p>
“During the day, also, we saw soldiers of the three nations, viz. English,
Portuguese, and French, all plundering at the same time in one
unfortunate house, where our pie, our pig, and wine had been left. It
stood about 150 or 200 yards below the church, on a sort of neutral
ground between the two armies; hence the assemblage at the same
moment of such a group of these motley marauders. <em>They plundered in
perfect harmony, no one disturbing the other on account of his nation
or colour.</em>”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_261" href="#FNanchor_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> “The mist hung heavily; and the French masses, at one moment
quite shrouded in vapour, at another dimly seen, or looming sudden and
large and dark at different points, appeared like thunder-clouds gathering
before the storm. At half-past eight, Soult pushed back the British
pickets in the centre; the sun burst out at that moment, the sparkling fire
of the light troops spread wide in the valley, and crept up the hills on
either flank, while the bellowing of forty pieces of artillery shook the
banks of the Nive and the Adour. Darricau, marching on the French
right, was directed against General Pringle. D’Armagnac, moving on
their left and taking Old Monguerre as the point of direction, was
ordered to force Byng’s right. Abbé assailed the centre at St. Pierre,
where General Stewart commanded; for Sir Rowland Hill had taken his
station on a commanding mount in the rear, from whence he could see the
whole battle and direct the movements.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_262" href="#FNanchor_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> “This glorious battle was fought and won by Sir Rowland Hill with
his own corps, alone and unassisted. Lord Wellington could not reach
the field till the victory was achieved, and as he rode up to his successful
general, he shook him heartily by the hand, with the frank remark, ‘Hill,
the day’s your own.’ He was exceedingly delighted with Sir Rowland’s
calm and beautiful conduct of this action, and with the intrepid and resolute
behaviour of the troops.”—<i>Sherer.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_263" href="#FNanchor_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> “A Frankfort officer now made his way to the outposts of our fourth
division in the centre of the allies, and announced the intended defection,
requiring a general officer’s word of honour that they should be
well-received and sent to Germany: no general being on the spot, Colonel
Bradford gave his word; means were immediately taken to apprise the battalions,
and they came over in a body, thirteen hundred men, the French
not discovering their intention till just when it was too late to frustrate
it.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_264" href="#FNanchor_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> “During this period of mutual repose, the French officers and ours
soon became intimate: we used to meet at a narrow part of the river, and
talk over the campaign. They would never believe (or pretended not to
believe) the reverse of Napoleon in Germany; and when we received the
news of the Orange Boven affair in Holland, they said that it was impossible
to convince them. One of our officers took <i>The Star</i> newspaper,
rolled a stone up in it, and attempted to throw it across the river; unfortunately
the stone went through it, and it fell into the water: the French
officer very quietly said, in tolerably good English, “Your good news is
very soon damped!“—<i>Batty.</i>

<p>
“During the campaign, we had often experienced the most gentlemanlike
conduct from the French officers. A day or two before the battle,
when we were upon our alarm-post, at break of day, a fine hare was seen
playing in a corn-field between the outposts; a brace of greyhounds were
very soon unslipped, when, after an excellent course, poor puss was killed
within the French lines. The officer to whom the dogs belonged, bowing
to the French officer, called off the dogs, but the Frenchman politely sent
the hare, with a message and his compliments, saying, that we required it
more than they did.”
</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>
“A daring fellow, an Irishman, named Tom Patten, performed a singular
feat. At the barrier there was a rivulet, along which our lines of sentries
were posted. To the right was a thick, low wood, and during the
cessation of hostilities our officers had again become intimate with those of
the French, and the soldiers had actually established a traffic in tobacco
and brandy in the following ingenious manner. A large stone was placed
in that part of the rivulet screened by the wood, opposite to the French sentry,
on which our people used to put a canteen with a quarter-dollar, for
which it was very soon filled with brandy. One afternoon about dusk,
Patten had put down his canteen with the usual money in it, and retired,
but, though he returned several times, no canteen was there. He waited
till the moon rose, but still he found nothing on the stone. When it was
near morning, Tom thought he saw the same sentry who was there when
he put his canteen down; so he sprang across the stream, seized the unfortunate
Frenchman, wrested his firelock from him, and actually shaking
him out of his accoutrements, recrossed, vowing he would keep them
until he got his canteen of brandy, and brought them to the picket-house.
Two or three hours afterwards, just as we were about to fall in, an hour
before daybreak, the sergeant came to say that a flag of truce was at the
barrier: I instantly went down, when I found the officer of the French
picket in a state of great alarm, saying, that a most extraordinary circumstance
had occurred (relating the adventure), and stating, that if the sentry’s
arms and accoutrements were not given back, his own commission would
be forfeited, as well as the life of the poor sentry. A sergeant was instantly
sent to see if they were in the picket-house; when Patten came up scratching
his head, saying “He had them in pawn for a canteen of brandy and
a quarter-dollar and told us the story in his way; whereupon the things
were immediately given over to the French captain, who, stepping behind,
put two five-franc pieces into Patten’s hand. Tom, however, was not to
be bribed by an enemy, but generously handed the money to his officer,
requesting that he would insist on the French captain taking the money
back.
</p>
<p>
“The Frenchman was delighted to get the firelock and accoutrements
back, and the joy of the poor fellow who was stripped of them may be conceived,
as, if it had been reported, he would certainly have been shot, by
sentence of court-martial, in less than forty-eight hours.”—<i>Cadell.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_265" href="#FNanchor_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> This general statement must unfortunately be qualified—for never
was a commander more sadly perplexed for want of money. “We are
just as bad as the Spaniards. <em>I yesterday wanted to send off a courier
to General W. Clinton in Catalonia, and the money for his expenses was
borrowed from those who happened to have a little to lend.</em>”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_266" href="#FNanchor_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> The Adour, like the Gave, is a name common to many rivers in the
Pyrenees, both simply meaning water in some of those primeval languages,
the remains of which are still widely preserved in the appellations
of rivers and mountains. The greater and noted stream, into which the
others are received, has its sources in the county of Bigorre, under
the Pics du Midi and d’Espade, two of the highest mountains in the
chain; it passes by Campan, Bagnères, Montgaillard, and Tarbes, and
begins to be navigable near Grenade, a small town in the little county of
Marsan. Having been joined by the Douze on the right below Tartas, it
inclines to the south-west from its junction, passes Acqs, and then holds
an almost southerly course to meet the Gave de Pau, which brings with
its own waters those of the Gave d’Oleron, into which the Gave de
Mauleon has been received. The Adour is then joined by the Bidouse,
and lastly by the Nive.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_267" href="#FNanchor_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> “A halberd was set up, with a handkerchief fixed to it, and upon
this point the chasse-marées boldly stood in for the river. Mr. Bloye,
the master’s mate of the Lyra, led the passage. His boat was lost, and
the whole of the crew drowned: several others shared the same fate.
Captain Elliot, of the Martial, with the surgeon of that vessel and four
seamen, and two belonging to the Porcupine, were amongst those who
perished. Three transport-boats, with their crews, were also lost. All
eyes were turned to witness the vessels plunging through the huge waves
that rolled over the bar. A Spanish chasse-marée had nearly struggled
through the surf, when an enormous wave was seen gradually nearing the
vessel; and, just before it reached it, raising its curling ridge high above
the deck, with one fatal sweep bore it down to the bottom. A moment
after parts of the shattered vessel rose to the surface, and exhibited the
wretched mariners clinging to its fragments: some were drifted till they
actually got footing on the shore, and, as it was flood-tide, hopes were
entertained of saving them by means of ropes thrown to them; but another
tremendous wave rolling majestically on to the beach, in a moment
bore them away for ever.”—<i>Batty.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_268" href="#FNanchor_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> It consisted of six-and-twenty chasse-marées, lashed to each other,
and moored by the bow and stem to resist the current that changed
at ebb and flow. Heavy guns were occasionally substituted for anchors;
and cables were strained by capstans across the centre of the decks, with
strong oak planks laid transversely, and sufficiently secured to form a
platform, at the same time pliant and substantial—calculated to rise or
fall with the tide—and strong enough to support the weight of artillery.
Immense stone piers had been erected by the French to contract the
channel of the stream, and, by an artificial current, prevent the sand from
accumulating on the bar. These, from their breadth, formed an admirable
causeway, while they lessened the space of water to be bridged to an
extent of two hundred and seventy yards. It was supposed by French
engineers impracticable to secure pontoons so as to resist the ocean swells
and mountain floods to which the Adour was so constantly exposed; but
a fortunate shifting of a sand-bank formed an excellent breakwater;
while a boom was laid above the bridge to arrest fire-ships or floating
timber, which it might have been expected the enemy would employ for
its destruction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_269" href="#FNanchor_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> “A few rocket-men were hastily sent across the river, and posted on
the sandhills to aid in repelling the enemy; and two guns of the troops
of horse-artillery were so placed on the left bank of the river, as to be
able to flank by their fire the troops coming on to attack the front of the
guards.
</p>
<p>
“The enemy came on a little before dusk of evening with drums beating
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pas-de-charge</i>, and driving before him the pickets sent out by
General Stopford to reconnoitre. The guards awaited the approach of
the French columns till within a short distance of their front, and then
commenced a well-directed fire; the guns on the left bank began to cannonade
them, and the rockets on the sandhills were discharged with terrific
effect, piercing the enemy’s column, killing several men, and blazing
through it with the greatest violence. The result was the almost immediate
rout of the French, who, terror-struck at the unusual appearance,
and at the effect of the rockets, and the immovable firmness of the little
corps, made the best of their retreat back towards the citadel, leaving a
number of killed and wounded on the ground. This gallant little combat
closed the events of the day.”—<i>Batty.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_270" href="#FNanchor_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> “There was a prejudice in the army against this weapon, which had
hitherto not been used in the field; the opinion seems to have been, that
if it had been an efficient means of destruction, it would sooner have been
borrowed from the East Indian nations. Lord Wellington, however, was
willing that they should be tried; and some experiments which were made
at Fontarabia gave reason for supposing that they might be found useful
on the Adour. The direction of this new arm was assigned to Sir
Augustus Fraser, but the trial was to be made under all the disadvantages
of inexperience; for the corps was composed of men hastily brought
together, and entirely ignorant of the arm they were to use; and the
rockets themselves were equipped in five different ways, and consequently
liable to as many failures.”—<i>Southey.</i>
</p>
<p>
A twelve-pounder rocket laid on the ground, and discharged without
a tube, by simply applying a match to the vent, will run along the ground
four or five hundred yards, seldom rising higher than a man’s head; and
then, alternately rising and falling, will continue its course with such effect,
as, after ranging 1200 yards, to pierce through twenty feet of turf, and
explode on the other side, scattering the seventy-two carbine balls, with
which it was loaded, in all directions. No barricade could for an instant
retard its force; and should it by any accident strike against a stone, or
any obstacle which it cannot pierce or overturn, it will bound off, and
continue its terrible course.
</p>
<p>
They are of various dimensions, as well in length as in calibre, and are
differently armed, according as they are intended for the field or for bombardment,—carrying,
in the first instance, either shells or case-shot,
which may be exploded at any part of their flight, spreading death and
destruction among the columns of the enemy; and in the second, where
they are intended for the destruction of buildings, shipping, stores, &amp;c.
they are armed with a peculiar species of composition which never fails of
destroying every combustible material with which it comes in contact:
the latter are called carcass-rockets.
</p>
<p>
The powers of this weapon are now established upon the best of all testimonies—that
of the enemy; a striking instance of which occurred at the
siege of Flushing, where General Monnet, the French commandant, made
a formal remonstrance to Lord Chatham respecting the use of them in
that bombardment.
</p>
<p>
The form of all the different kinds of these rockets is cylindrical, and
they are composed of strong metallic cases, armed, as before stated, either
with carcass composition for bombardment and conflagration, or with
shells and case-shot for field-service. They are, however, of various
weights and dimensions, from the eight-inch carcass, or explosion-rocket,
weighing nearly three hundredweight, to the six-pound shell-rocket,
which is the smallest size used in the field. The sticks which are employed
for regulating their flight are also of different lengths, according to the
size and service of the rocket, and which, for the convenience of carriage,
are stowed apart from the rocket, and so contrived as to consist of two or
more parts, which are connected to it, and to each other when requisite,
with the utmost expedition.
</p>
<p>
They are divided into three classes, heavy, medium, and light,—the
former including all those of above forty-two pounds, which are denominated
according to their calibre, as eight-inch, seven-inch, six-inch, &amp;c.
rockets; the medium include all those from the forty-two pound to the
twenty-four pound rocket; and the light, from the eighteen-pounder to
the six-pounder, inclusive. The carcass-rockets are armed with strong
iron conical heads, containing a composition as hard and solid as iron
itself, and which, when once inflamed, bids defiance to any human effort
to extinguish it, and, consequently, involves in an inextinguishable flame
every combustible material with which it comes in contact. The forty-two
pounder and thirty-two pounder carcass-rockets are those which have
hitherto been chiefly employed in bombardments. The penetration of the
thirty-two pound carcass-rocket, in common ground, is nine feet,—and in
some instances where they have been employed, have been known to pierce
through several floors, and through the sides of houses: this is the smallest
rocket used in bombardment, and the largest employed in the field,—the
more usual size for the latter service being the twenty-four, eighteen,
twelve, and six-pounders. The ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and
six-inch rockets, are from 2,000 to 2,500 yards; and the quantity of combustible
matter, or bursting powder, from twenty-five to fifty pounds;
and from their weight, combined with less diameter, they possess a greater
power of penetration than the heaviest shells, and are therefore equally
efficient for the destruction of bomb-proofs, or the demolition of strong
buildings.
</p>
<p>
The largest rocket that has yet been constructed has not, we believe,
weighed more than three hundred-weight.
</p>
<p>
The forty-two and thirty-two pounders are those which have hitherto
been principally used in bombardment, and which, for the general purposes
of that service, are found quite sufficient, as they will convey from
seven pounds to ten pounds of combustible matter each, and have a range
of upwards of three thousand yards. The thirty-two pounder rocket may
be considered as the medium rocket, being the smallest used in bombardment
as a carcass or explosion rocket, and the largest used with shot or
shell in the field; but as the twenty-four pounder is very nearly equal to
it in all its applications in the latter service, being quite equal to the propelling
of the Cohorn shell, or twelve-pounder shot, it is, from the saving
in weight, generally preferred to the thirty-two pounder. The eighteen-pounder,
which is the first of the light nature of rockets, is armed with a
nine-pound shot or shell; the twelve pounder with a six-pound ditto; the
nine-pounder with a grenade; and the six-pounder with a three-pound
shot or shell. From the twenty-four pounder to the nine-pounder rocket,
inclusive, a description of case-shot rocket is formed of each nature,
armed with a quantity of musket or carbine balls put into the top of the
cylinder of the rocket.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_271" href="#FNanchor_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> The citadel of Bayonne is a truly formidable work, standing on a
commanding hill upon the right bank of the Adour, and greatly elevated
above all the other defences of the city, nearly fronting the mouth of the
Nive. It is almost a perfect square, with strongly-built oreillon bastions
at the four angles. A double range of barracks and magazines inclose a
quadrangular space in the centre called the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">place d’armes</i>, the sides of
which are parallel with the curtains of the citadel.
</p>

till they reached the point the French intended they should reach,

before. Few troops would have remained unshaken by such a reception,
but to the Spaniards it was intolerable; consequently they broke into a
thousand parties, and, turning tail, it was who should be first away from
such unpleasant doings. I am told that Lord Wellington at this moment
‘wondered whether the Pyrenees would bring them up again, they seemed
to have got such a fright.’ He did not indeed depend on their valour, or
he would have made a bad winding up of his Peninsular campaign. The
moment they left the height, every man took the way that seemed to him
best, and they soon after literally covered the whole plain, and set to work
with all expedition to plunder.”—<i>Surtees.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_275" href="#FNanchor_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> What, let it be simply asked, were the relative objects of Soult and
Wellington? Was it not with one to hold a city that the other was as
anxious to obtain? And what were the results? Soult, after his defeat
at Tarbes, had made forced marches to complete the defences of Toulouse,
and garrison a place to which he attached such value. His opponent
advanced more leisurely; for, as the end was great, so also were the
means limited and the difficulties many. Were they not surmounted?
“He desired to pass the Garonne, and he did pass it; he desired to win
the position and works of Mont Rave, and he did win them; he desired
to enter Toulouse, and he did enter it as a conqueror at the head of his
troops.”—<i>Napier.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_276" href="#FNanchor_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> The allied loss, according to official reports, was five hundred and
ninety-five killed, four thousand and forty-six wounded, and eighteen
missing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_277" href="#FNanchor_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> “The enemy erected a tall mast on the cavalier of the south-west
bastion, supporting a sort of round top, boarded at the sides, for the purpose
of placing there a sentinel, who was thus enabled to overlook the
positions of the allies all round. This was a subject of great jealousy to
our soldiers, who were anxious to see the first cannon directed against so
dangerous an overseer, whom they always designated by the name of
‘Jack in the box.’ Many of them amused themselves in drawing rude
sketches on the garden walls and sides of the houses with burnt sticks,
apparently consoling themselves by representing ‘Jack in his box,’ with
outstretched arms, in the moment of expiring from a cannon-shot, which
was duly depicted: their animosity was, in fact, very particularly directed
against this, as they called it, unfair advantage.”—<i>Batty.</i>
</p>
<p>
“At Bayonne, occasional instances occurred which shewed the extreme
accuracy of the French artillery-men in pointing their cannon, and afforded
the most convincing proofs of the absolute necessity of keeping our sentinels
in places where they could not be discovered, and where, through
holes pierced for that purpose in the garden walls, or through the hedges,
they could observe the enemy’s movements without necessary exposure.
A soldier of the German Legion had been posted at the angle of a large
house, with directions to look round the corner from time to time, but on
no account to remain exposed. Unfortunately he placed one leg beyond
the angle of the building, and in a moment afterwards it was carried off
by a cannon-shot. This might have been accidental, but a second and
third instance immediately following served to convince us it was not so.
A soldier of the light infantry, belonging to those stationed at St. Bernard
under the command of Lord Saltoun, was posted behind a breastwork dug
across the road which leads from the suburb of St. Etienne towards Bouraut,
not far from the bank of the Adour. This road was looked down
upon from the citadel, and was guarded with extreme jealousy by the
enemy. The soldier was desired occasionally to look over the breastwork,
but always to conceal himself again as quickly as possible; he, however,
had the rashness to stand boldly upright on it, and was instantaneously
killed by a cannon-ball, which literally cut him in two.

“A similar instance of their accuracy in firing occurred on the 23rd of
February, when Colonel Maitland’s brigade took shelter behind the sandhills
on the borders of the marsh in front of the intrenched camp. A
drummer in the 3rd battalion of the first Guards had got upon the summit
of the sandhill, but had not been there many moments before a cannon-shot,
fired from a battery of the intrenched camp nearest to the
Adour, pierced the ground directly underneath his feet, and brought down
the frightened drummer headlong amongst his comrades below, who were
much amused on discovering that he had not sustained the slightest
injury.”</p></div>

of Dalmatia and the Duke of Albufera being desirous of concluding a
suspension of hostilities between the armies under their respective orders,
and of agreeing upon a line of demarcation, have named the undermentioned
officers for that purpose; viz. on the part of the Marquis of Wellington,
Major-General Sir George Murray, and Major-General Don
Luis Wimpffen; and, on the part of the Duke of Dalmatia and of the
Duke of Albufera, the General of Division Count Gazin.
</p>
<p>
These officers having exchanged their full powers have agreed upon the
following articles:—
</p>
<p>
Art. I.—From the date of the present convention there shall be a suspension
of hostilities between the allied armies under the orders of Field-Marshal
the Marquis of Wellington, and the armies of France under the
orders of Marshal the Duke of Dalmatia and of Marshal the Duke of
Albufera.
</p>
<p>
Art. II.—Hostilities shall not be recommenced on either part without
a previous notice being given of five days.
</p>
<p>
Art. III.—The limits of the department of the Haute Garonne, with
the departments of Arriege, Aude, and Tarn, shall be the line of demarcation
between the armies as far as the town of Buzet, on the river Tarn.
The line will then follow the course of the Tarn to its junction with the
Garonne, making a circuit, however, on the left bank of the Tarn opposite
Montauban, to the distance of three-quarters of a league from the
bridge of Montauban. From the mouth of the river Tarn, the line of
demarcation will follow the right bank of the Garonne, as far as the limits
of the department of the Lot and Garonne, with the department of La
Gironde. It will then pass by La Reole, Sanveterre, and Rauzan, to the
Dordogne, and will follow the right bank of that river, and of the
Gironde, to the sea. In the event, however, of a different line of demarcation
having been already determined by Lieutenant-General the Earl
of Dalhousie and General Decden, the line fixed upon by those officers
shall be adhered to.
</p>
<p>
Art. IV.—Hostilities shall cease also on both sides in regard to the
places of Bayonne, St. Jean de Pied de Port, Navarreins, Blaye, and the
castle of Lourdes.
</p>
<p>
The governors of these places shall be allowed to provide for the daily
subsistence of the garrisons in the adjacent country, the garrison of
Bayonne with a circuit of eight leagues from Bayonne, and the garrisons
of the other places named within a circuit of three leagues round each
place.
</p>
<p>
Officers shall be sent to the garrisons of the above places to communicate
to them the terms of the present convention.
</p>
<p>
Art. V.—The town and forts of Santona shall be evacuated by the
French troops, and made over to the Spanish forces. The French garrison
will remove with it all that properly belongs to it, together with
such arms, artillery, and other military effects as have not been the property
originally of the Spanish government.
</p>
<p>
The Marquis of Wellington will determine whether the French garrison
of Santona shall return to France by land or by sea, and, in either case,
the passage of the garrison shall be secured, and it will be directed upon
one of the places or ports most contiguous to the army of the Duke of
Dalmatia.
</p>
<p>
The ships of war or other vessels now in the harbour of Santona,
belonging to France, shall be allowed to proceed to Rochfort with passports
for that purpose.
</p>
<p>
The Duke of Dalmatia will send an officer to communicate to the
French general commanding in Santona the terms of the present convention,
and cause them to be complied with.
</p>
<p>
Art. VI.—The fort of Venasque shall be made over as soon as possible
to the Spanish troops, and the French garrison shall proceed by the
most direct route to the head-quarters of the French army: the garrison
will remove with it the arms and ammunition which are originally
French.
</p>
<p>
Art. VII.—The line of demarcation between the allied armies and the
army of Marshal Suchet, shall be the line of the frontier of Spain and
France, from the Mediterranean to the limits of the department of the
Haute Garonne.
</p>
<p>
Art. VIII.—The garrison of all the places which are occupied by the
troops of the army of the Duke of Albufera shall be allowed to return
without delay into France. These garrisons shall remove with them all
that properly belongs to them, as also the arms and artillery which are
originally French.
</p>
<p>
The garrison of Murviedro and of Peniscola shall join the garrison of
Tortosa, and these troops will then proceed together by the great road,
and enter France by Perpignan. The day of the arrival of these garrisons
at Gerona, the fortresses of Figueras and of Rosas shall be made over to
the Spanish troops, and the French garrisons of these places shall proceed
to Perpignan.
</p>
<p>
As soon as information is received of the French garrisons of Murviedro,
Peniscola, and Tortosa, having passed the French frontier, the place
and forts of Barcelona shall be made over to the Spanish troops, and the
French garrisons shall march immediately for Perpignan. The Spanish
authorities will provide for the necessary means of transport being supplied
to the French garrisons on their march to the frontier.
</p>
<p>
The sick or wounded of any of the French garrisons who are not in a
state to move with the troops, shall remain and be cured in the hospitals
where they are, and will be sent into France as soon as they have recovered.
</p>
<p>
Art. IX.—From the date of the ratifications of the present convention,
there shall not be removed from Peniscola, Murviedro, Tortosa, Barcelona,
or any of the other places, any artillery, arms, ammunition, or any
other military effects belonging to the Spanish government. And the
provisions remaining at the evacuation of these places shall be made over
to the Spanish authorities.
</p>
<p>
Art. X.—The roads shall be free for the passage of couriers through
the cantonments of both armies, provided they are furnished with regular
passports.
</p>
<p>
Art. XI.—During the continuance of the present convention, deserters
from either army shall be arrested, and shall be delivered up if demanded.
</p>
<p>
Art. XII.—The navigation of the Garonne shall be free from Toulouse
to the sea, and all boats in the service of either army, employed in the
river, shall be allowed to pass unmolested.
</p>
<p>
Art. XIII.—The cantonments of the troops shall be arranged so as to
leave a space of two leagues at least between the quarters of the different
armies.
</p>
<p>
Art. XIV.—The movements of the troops for the establishment of their
cantonments, shall commence immediately after the ratification of the present
convention.
</p>
<p>
The ratification is to take place within twenty-four hours for the army
of the Duke of Dalmatia, and within forty-eight hours for the army of the
Duke of Albufera.

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_284" href="#FNanchor_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> It would appear, that to some unaccountable fatality that sanguinary
affair must be attributed. Rumours had already reached the outposts,
that Napoleon had abdicated—and although from these reports the vigilance
of the blockading army might have been naturally expected to
abate, the besieged should have remained merely on the defensive, and
Thouvenot’s sortie was unwarrantable. The result was not to his advantage.
His casualties were admitted to reach nine hundred men, and the
allied were nearly equal—both losing a general. The siege had not commenced—for
neither stores nor artillery had been brought forward—hence,
there was no immediate cause for apprehension; and, though
nothing was known certainly, it was generally believed that Napoleon was
either dead or dethroned. The operation, therefore, appears rather designed
to gratify bad passions than attain any military object. It seemed
to have been purely a work of slaughter—and to gain no end, men were
unnecessarily lost. “On both sides the troops, broken into small bodies
by the inclosures, and unable to recover their order, came dashing
together in the darkness, fighting often with the bayonet, and sometimes
friends encountered, sometimes foes: all was tumult and horror. The
guns of the citadel, vaguely guided by the flashes of the musketry, sent
their shot and shells booming at random through the lines of fight; and
the gun-boats, dropping down the river, opened their fire upon the flank
of the supporting columns, which being put in motion by Sir John Hope,
on the first alarm, were now coming up from the side of Boucaut. Thus
nearly one hundred pieces of artillery were in full play at once; and the
shells having set fire to the fascine depôts and to several houses, the flames
cast a horrid glare over the striving masses.”—<i>Napier.</i>
</p>
<p>
At best it was a sanguinary experiment. No object was gained or could
be gained—much blood was idly wasted—Thouvenot, in a few hours, was
as closely inclosed, as he had been before his sally—his loss exceeded that
inflicted on his enemy—and many of his casualties were caused by the
indiscriminating fire of his own guns.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_297" href="#FNanchor_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> From its immediate connexion with the battles of Quatre-Brass and
Waterloo, a brief sketch of the sanguinary engagement at Ligny will be
given.
</p>
<p>
Although burning to commence his attack upon his old and formidable
antagonist, the bad roads and inclement weather that delayed Bulow’s
march, prevented the completion of Napoleon’s dispositions until the day
was far advanced. Blucher’s<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> position embraced the heights between
Bry and Sombref, with the villages of Ligny and St. Amand.
The ground was well adapted for defence,<a id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> the surface being undulated
and broken, and covered with farm-yards and orchards. The villages
were naturally strong, standing on the crest of a ravine skirted by trees
and copse-wood.
</p>
<p>
At three o’clock Napoleon’s order of battle was completed, and
Vandamme’s corps commenced the engagement by attacking the village
of St. Amand.
</p>
<p>
The French leader’s judgment was correct in selecting the right of the
Prussians for his first effort. It was the more assailable, because Blucher,
anxious to secure his centre at Ligny, had concentrated his best troops
there; and from the Prussian position being considerably in advance of
Quatre Bras, had Napoleon effected his object, and turned the right flank,
he must certainly have succeeded in cutting off the communication
between the allied commanders, as he would have possessed the great
road from Namur to Nivelles. Napoleon’s calculations were just; and
the Prussian centre was materially weakened by sending succours to the
right.
</p>
<p>
At first the impetuosity of the French attack was successful, and Petit
Amand was carried by Lefol’s brigade with the bayonet. Blucher in
person re-attacked the village, and in turn the French were expelled.
These varying successes led to a murderous conflict. Girard’s<a id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a> division
came to Vandamme’s support, and succeeded in gaining the churchyard,
while Blucher held the heights above the village in such force as rendered
any forward movement of the French impracticable.
</p>
<p>
From this conflict on the right the battle gradually extended, until the
opposing armies were generally engaged: Ligny was furiously assaulted,
while Grouchy endeavoured to turn the Prussian left at Sombref.
</p>
<p>
Nothing could equal the fury with which every part of the position was
assailed but the obstinacy with which it was defended. Every orchard
and enclosure was only to be carried after a sanguinary encounter. The
villages were furiously contested; the combatants fought hand-to-hand;
regiment met regiment with the bayonet; and Ligny, within the space of
five hours, was six times won and lost. This seemed the chosen field of
slaughter; the streets were heaped with dead; reserves, coming from
either armies as battalions, one after another were annihilated. Two
hundred pieces of cannon poured their torrents of round and grape upon
the village. The French columns at last gained ground: the Prussian
charge of cavalry failed in repulsing them; and in attempting to repel
the cuirassiers, Blucher was dismounted, and escaped death or captivity
by a miracle.<a id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a>
</p>
<p>
Evening came,—the battle raged with unabated fury—both armies
fighting with desperate fierceness, and as yet no decisive advantage gained.
The French were masters of the burning village; the mill of Bussey and
heights commanding Ligny were still occupied by the Prussians.
</p>
<p>
These Napoleon determined to carry by a grand effort, and the Imperial
Guard, the reserve of the fourth corps, and a brigade of cuirassiers, under
a storm of artillery, traversed the village and assailed the mill and heights;
a desperate encounter ensued. The Imperial Guard attacked the Prussian
squares with the bayonet, while at the same moment the rival cavalry were
charging. Neither party would yield ground; the ground was heaped with
corpses, blood flowed in torrents, and still the battle raged. Darkness,
however, favoured the advance of a French division, which had made a
circuitous movement from the village, the Prussians found their flank
turned and the enemy on the point of attacking their rear. Without a
reserve, for that had been already detached to strengthen the right, and
having ascertained that Wellington could hardly maintain himself at
Quatre Bras, and that Bulow could not get up in time, Blucher determined
to retreat on Tilly and unite himself with the fourth corps. At
ten o’clock the order to fall back was given, and the centre and right
retrograded in perfect order. Forming again within a quarter of a league
of the field of battle, they recommenced their retreat; and, unmolested
by the enemy, retired upon Wavre, while the French occupied the ground
the Prussians had abandoned, and bivouacked on the heights.
</p>
<p>
Zeithen, who commanded the right of the Prussians, evaded Vandamme’s
attempts to detain him, and fell back, keeping his communications with
the centre unbroken, while Theilman repulsed Grouchy’s attack upon
Sombref, and after holding the village of Bire during the night, retreated
at daylight and formed a junction with Bulow at Gemblaux.
</p>
<p>
“Blucher’s retreat was most judicious. He calculated that the English
commander must fall back from Quatre Bras, and accordingly by retiring
upon Wavre, his line of retreat was parallel with that of Wellington upon
Waterloo.
</p>
<p>
“It may be anticipated that the loss sustained in this long and desperate
conflict was on both sides tremendous. Buonaparte stated his killed
and wounded at three thousand men; but it has been clearly ascertained
that it amounted to double that number. The Prussians suffered dreadfully.
They left fifteen thousand men upon the field—and they may be
stated as having perished; for the unrelenting ferocity with which both
sides fought, prevented quarter from being asked or given. Fifteen pieces
of cannon, which Blucher had abandoned, comprised the trophies of the
victory, if a battle gained under such circumstances, and unattended with
a single important result, deserves that title.”</p></div>

<p class="fn1a"><a id="Footnote_H" href="#FNanchor_H" class="fnanchor">H</a>From the similarity of sound, the names of Gerard and Girard have
been frequently confused. The latter commanded a division of the reserve

<p class="fn1a"><a id="Footnote_I" href="#FNanchor_I" class="fnanchor">I</a>The French cavalry followed up their success, and then it was that
Blucher so narrowly escaped captivity,—a fate that, to him, would have
been worse than death itself. His horse, a beautiful grey charger, the
gift of the Prince Regent of England, had been wounded: it broke down,
and fell just as the lancers turned to fly from the pursuing enemy.
“Now, Nostitz, I am lost!” said the gallant rider to his aide-de-camp,
at the moment that he sunk beneath the dying steed. Count Nostitz,
who, in the confusion, had alone remained by his side, instantly leaped to
the ground, and, sword in hand, stood over his fallen chief, while the
whole body of the French cavalry passed on, totally unmindful of the
group. Before, however, the count could take advantage of the calm, and
extricate the general from beneath the dead charger, the Prussians had
turned upon their pursuers, and forced the cuirassiers to retrograde as fast
as they had come: so that the whole of the broken rout again rushed by
the fallen marshal. As soon as the Prussians (who knew nothing of what
had happened to their leader) arrived, Nostitz seized the bridle of a non-commissioned
officer’s horse, and, with the aid of the soldier, placed the
bruised and almost insensible commander in the saddle, and hurried him
from the field.</p></div>

to Brussels. It is half a league from the château of Hougomont and La
Haye Sainte, and a quarter of a league from La Belle Alliance and
Planchenoit. Supper was hastily served up in part of the utensils of the
farmer that remained. Buonaparte slept in the first chamber of this
house: a bed with blue silk hangings and gold fringe was put up for him
in the middle of this room. His brother Jerome, the Duke of Bassano,
and several generals, lodged in the other chambers. All the adjacent

Field of Trimotio, and is the property of several individuals: it is not

moment during the battle. After he had lost it, endeavouring to avoid
the crowd in the great road, he threw himself into the orchard opposite
this farm-house to get the start of the mass of fugitives. A part of these,
being closely pursued, sought refuge in the buildings of the farm; they
were set on fire, and several of them reduced to ashes.—<i>Letters of a

beech, an orchard, and a hedge, by which the wall was concealed; in
another part, there was a pond, serving as a moat. Steps were taken
to strengthen these means of defence by loop-holing, or perforating the
walls, for the fire of musketry; and erecting scaffolding, to give the
troops within an opportunity of firing from the top of the wall. The
enemy’s cannon could only be brought to bear upon the upper part of

Probably the statement of an enemy will bear the noblest testimony
to the measureless bravery of the British infantry. A French general thus
notices them:—“We saw these sons of Albion, formed in square battalions,
in the plain between the wood of Hougomont and the village of
Mount Saint John; and to effect this compact formation, they had doubled
and redoubled their ranks several times. The cavalry which supported
them was cut to pieces, and the fire of their artillery completely silenced,
and generals and staff officers were galloping from one square to
another, not knowing where to find shelter. Carriages, wounded men,
parks of reserve, and auxiliary troops, were all flying in disorder towards
Brussels. Death was before them, and in their ranks; disgrace in their
rear! In this terrible situation, neither the bullets (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boulets</i>, cannon-balls)
of the Imperial Guard, discharged almost point blank, nor the victorious
cavalry of France, could make the least impression on the immoveable
British infantry. One might have been almost tempted to fancy
that it had rooted itself in the ground, but for the <em>majestic movement</em>
which its battalions <em>commenced</em> some minutes after sunset, at the moment
when the approach of the Prussian army apprised Wellington that he had
just achieved the most decisive victory of the age.”—<i>Foy.</i></p></div>

three regiments of cavalry were in the most masterly style wheeled into
line, and presented a most beautiful front of about thirteen hundred men:
as his lordship rode down the line, he was received by a general shout
and cheer from the brigade. After having taken a short survey of the
force and threatening attitude of the enemy, and finding the Highland
brigade, although still presenting an unbroken front, upon the point of
being on both sides outflanked by an immense superiority of numbers,
his lordship determined upon a charge, which, for the wonderful intrepidity
of its execution, and its complete success, has rarely been equalled,
and certainly never surpassed. The Royals appeared to take the lead,
while the Greys preserved a beautiful line at speed; more to the left
over the cross-road, near which spot their brave chief, Colonel Hamilton,
fell.”</p></div>

desolation, for the objects of their love. Mothers and wives and children

“In many places the dead lay four deep upon each other, marking the
spot some British square had occupied, when exposed for hours to the
murderous fire of a French battery. Outside, lancer and cuirassier were
scattered thickly on the earth. Madly attempting to force the serried
bayonets of the British, they had fallen in the bootless essay, by the
musketry of the inner files. Farther on, you traced the spot where the
cavalry of France and England had encountered. Chasseur and hussar
were intermingled; and the heavy Norman horse of the Imperial Guard
were interspersed with the grey chargers which had carried Albyn’s
chivalry. Here the Highlander and tirailleur lay, side by side together;
and the heavy dragoon, with ‘green Erin’s’ badge upon his helmet, was
grappling in death with the Polish lancer.”

“On the summit of the ridge, where the ground was cumbered with
dead, and trodden fetlock-deep in mud and gore, by the frequent rush of
rival cavalry, the thick-strewn corpses of the Imperial Guard pointed out
the spot where Napoleon had been defeated. Here, in column, that
favoured corps, on whom his last chance rested, had been annihilated;
and the advance and repulse of the Guard was traceable by a mass of
fallen Frenchmen. In the hollow below, the last struggle of France had
been vainly made; for there the Old Guard, when the middle battalions
had been forced back, attempted to meet the British, and afford time for
their disorganized companions to rally. Here the British left, which had
converged upon the French centre, had come up;—and here the bayonet
closed the contest.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_316" href="#FNanchor_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> Buonaparte has been severely censured for daring to attack Wellington
and Blucher<a id="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">K</a> simultaneously. Had different results attended the battles
of Quatre Bras and Ligny, probably military criticism on Napoleon’s bold
plans would have been more favourable. Ney seems certainly to have
pointed out a safer course, and his idea of first overwhelming the British,
and afterwards taking the Prussians in detail, might have been more successful
had it been adopted. But even admitting, in part, that Napoleon’s
“arrangements” were erroneous, they still were worthy of the vigorous
and martial spirit that planned them. His great mistake may be traced to
a mind that refused to be controlled by cold calculation. He aimed at
more than he could accomplish. With limited means he acted upon a
great and comprehensive scheme; and, disdaining to recognise his weakness,
he pursued an object demanding ampler resources than he possessed.
This was sufficiently proved by the result; for he was unable to gather the
fruits of his triumph over the Prussians, whom he permitted to retreat
without the slightest interruption. His army contented itself with remaining
upon the ground it won so hardly, without even an attempt to
harass the slowly retiring columns of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
There have been conflicting statements as to whether Buonaparte did, or
did not know, that Bulow was in force in the rear of his right. Ney says,
that Labedoyère brought him a message from the emperor, that Grouchy,
at seven o’clock, had attacked the extreme left of the Anglo-Prussian
army, while Girard states, that at nine in the morning Napoleon knew that
a Prussian column, which had escaped the marshal (Grouchy), was advancing
in his rear. Gneisenau affirms, that the fourth Prussian corps
(Bulow’s) moved from Dien-le-Mont by Wavre on Saint Lambert at daybreak.
Certainly Buonaparte might have been acquainted with its advance
during the day; but whether he was or was not, its arrival at Waterloo
in the evening decided that day and his destiny.</p></div>

<p>
Every officer and soldier, I am persuaded, did his duty; but the Duke
of Wellington alone was capable of giving union to such a force. No
other man living could have rendered the service which he performed with
an army so composed.

<p>
The British cavalry and artillery of this army were superb and magnificent;
superior, perhaps, to any force of the kind which the world had
ever seen; and Marshal Blucher, who reviewed the former a short time
before the opening of the campaign, declared that he had not given the
world credit for containing so many fine men. The infantry, who, after
all, carried away the foremost honours of the day, were inferior in point
of men; there were many second battalions, composed entirely of lads
and recruits that had never seen a shot fired.</p></div>

to be established in all the Affghan dominions, with the single exception
of Herat, and the existence of that influence in those countries, viewed
in conjunction with the course which those powers have recently been
pursuing, and the measures that have resulted from their joint diplomatic
exertions, is so obviously incompatible with the tranquillity of India, and
even with its security, that no measures can be more unequivocally measures
of self-defence than those which the British government is called
upon to adopt for the purpose of counteracting the evils with which India
is threatened: Persia has no provocation to complain of. The course
pursued by the British government towards this government has been one
of uniform friendship and forbearance; and it appears to me that it would
be a hazardous and costly line of policy to adopt, were the British
government any longer to permit Persia, under shelter of her treaty with
England, to open the way to India for another and far more formidable
power.”—<i>McNeill’s Despatch, 8th August, 1838.</i></p></div>

surrounded by a fausse-braye and wet ditch. The irregular figure of the
‘enceinte’ gave a good flanking fire, whilst the height of the citadel
covered the interior from the commanding fire of the hills to the north,
rendering it nugatory. In addition to this, the towers at the angles had
been enlarged, screen-walls had been built before the gates, the ditch
cleared out and filled with water, stated to be unfordable, and an outwork
built upon the right bank, so as to command its bed.”—<i>Engineer’s

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_332" href="#FNanchor_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> “At this crisis, Brochard, an engineer officer, devised a plan, as remarkable
for its ingenuity as it was perfect in success. His project was
to blow down the centre barricade, destroy the cord which communicated
with the Portuguese mine, and, in the confusion, which the explosion
would be certain to produce, carry the bridge by assault. To place the
powder close beneath the palisades, without its being discovered, was both
a doubtful and a dangerous attempt; but to the brave nothing is impossible.
</p>
<p>
“The troops were quietly got under arms, and placed as near the head
of the bridge as their being concealed from the Portuguese guard would
permit; while, to call off the attention of the latter, some twenty men
were stationed to keep up a fire upon the intrenchments, so directed as
not to endanger the sappers, who had volunteered for the real service of
the hour. It was a service so hopeful and hazardous as to excite the
liveliest solicitude for its success. The barrel of powder was covered
with a grey cloak, that it might neither be heard nor seen, and the man
who undertook to deposit it in its place wore a cloak of the same colour.
The clear moonlight was favourable to the adventure, by the blackness of
the shadow which the parapet on one side produced. In that line of
darkness the sapper crept along at full-length, pushing the barrel before
him with his head, and guiding it with his hands. His instructions were
to stop if he heard the slightest movement on the Portuguese side; and
a string was fastened to one of his feet, by which the French were enabled
to know how far he had advanced, and to communicate with him. Having
placed the barrel, and uncovered that part where it was to be kindled, he
returned with the same caution. Four barrels, one after the other, were
thus arranged without alarming the Portuguese. The fourth adventurer
had not the same command of himself as his predecessors had evinced.
Possessed either with fear, or premature exultation, as soon as he had deposited
the barrel in its place, instead of making his way back slowly and
silently along the line of shadow, he rose and ran along the middle of the
bridge in the moonlight. He was seen, fired at, and shot in the thigh.
But the Portuguese did not take the alarm as they ought to have done;
they kept up a fire upon the entrance of the bridge, and made no attempt
to discover for what purpose their intrenchments had been approached so
closely.
</p>
<p>
“Four hours had elapsed before the four barrels were placed: by that
time it was midnight, and in another hour, when the Portuguese had
ceased their fire, a fifth volunteer proceeded in the same manner with a
saucisson fastened to his body; this he fixed in its place, and returned
safely. By two o’clock this part of the business was completed, and
Laborde was informed that all was ready. Between three and four a fog
arose from the river and filled the valley, so that the houses on the opposite
shore could scarcely be discerned through it. This was favourable
for the assailants. The saucisson was fired; and the explosion, as
Brochard had expected, threw down the intrenchments, and destroyed the
apparatus for communicating with the mine.”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_334" href="#FNanchor_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> On the 12th of November, Sir Willoughby Cotton, who, before he
reached India on his return home the previous year, had, in consequence
of the troubled appearance of things, been again placed in command of
the forces in Affghanistan, moved from Cabool with a portion of the
troops to Jellalabad, to winter there, and Dost Mahomed was escorted by
him so far on his way to Loodianah. At Peshawar the ex-ameer waited
the arrival of his family, who had resided at Ghuznee since they had been
under the protection of the British. Of his numerous sons all now had
surrendered except Akbar Khan, who continued to hold out to the last,
and eventually took terrible vengeance for all that his family had suffered.
The residence first appropriated to the use of our distinguished captive,
was the same that Shah Shoojah had occupied for so many years at
Loodianah; but he was afterwards removed to Mussoree, on the north-west
frontier of our territories, where the climate was better adapted for his
health. The pension we allowed him was three lacs of rupees, or £30,000
a year.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_335" href="#FNanchor_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> “Monson was as brave as any officer in the English army; second
to none in undaunted valour at storming a breach, but he wanted the
rarer quality of moral intrepidity, and the power of adopting great designs
on his own responsibility. On the 6th of July, Holkar was engaged in
crossing the Chumbul; the fortunate moment of attack, never to be recalled,
was allowed to escape; and two days afterwards the English
general commenced his retreat. He did what ordinary officers would have
done at Assaye, when it was ascertained Stevenson’s division could not
come up; and what was the result? In a few hours the subsidiary horse,
now four thousand strong, which was left to observe the enemy, was
enveloped by clouds of the Mahratta cavalry, and after a bloody struggle,
cut to pieces with their gallant commander.”
</p>
<p>
Painful as the sequel proved, it may yet be briefly told. Colonel
Monson gained the Makundra pass, and afterwards retreated to Kotah
and Rampoora, after abandoning his artillery. Reinforced by two battalions
and three thousand irregular horse, he quitted the fort and marched
directly for the British frontier. Heavy rains fell; and on reaching the
banks of the Bannas, he found the stream impassable. The position of
this ill-fated corps was truly desperate. “In their front was a raging
torrent, in their rear twenty thousand horsemen, continually receiving
fresh accessions of strength in infantry and guns, as they successively came
up. The river having at length become fordable, four battalions crossed
over; and the enemy, seeing his advantage, immediately commenced a
furious attack on the single battalion and pickets, which now remained
alone on the other side. With such heroic constancy, however, was this
unequal contest maintained by these brave men, that they not only repulsed
the whole attacks made upon them, but, pursuing their success, captured
several of the enemy’s guns; an event which clearly demonstrated what
results might have followed the adoption of a vigorous offensive in the
outset, when the troops were undiminished in strength and unbroken in
spirit.”
</p>
<p>
Disasters followed fast upon each other. The sepoy guard who accompanied
the military chests was attacked by the cavalry of Scindiah, their
own ally; and when the Mahrattas were defeated, they treacherously
deserted to Holkar. The whole of the irregular horse, which had
reinforced Monson at Rampoora, followed the example; and a few
companies of sepoys—a rare occurrence among those faithful people—quitted
their ranks, and joined this enemy. Formed in oblong square,
the greater portion of the latter part of the retreat was executed—fifteen
thousand horse incessantly harassing in front, flank, and rear, the
retiring column—and only kept at bay by the indomitable courage, and
unbroken formation of the remnant of this glorious division. At last,
worn down by fatigue, and reduced by casualties and desertion of twelve
thousand men, scarcely a thousand entered Agra, without cannon, baggage,
or ammunition, and only fit for the hospitals, and afterwards to be
invalided.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_336" href="#FNanchor_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> When the remnant of Bailey’s army were delivered up by that truculent
monster, Tippoo Sultaun, they were marched across the country to
Madras, a distance of four hundred miles. During the march, the
utmost pains were taken by Tippoo’s guards to keep the Hindoo privates
separate from their European officers, in the hope that their fidelity might
yet sink under the hardships to which they were exposed, but in vain;
and not only did they all remain true to their colours, but swam the
tanks and rivers by which they were separated from the officers during
the night, bringing them all they could save from their little pittance;
“for we,” they said, “can live on any thing, but you require beef and
mutton.”</p></div>

limits. On the north, it is bounded by one of the Himalaya ranges.
On the west by the Khybur and Soliman mountains and the Indus. On
the south and east the Sutlej divides it from British India. Its area is
computed to inclose 85,000 square miles. The arteries of the Indus,
namely the Jelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej, traverse the whole
country, and form its local divisions into what are termed doabs. The
Punjaub, being translated, hence means “the country of five rivers.”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_345" href="#FNanchor_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> There was great suffering everywhere for want of water. Hunger
men may endure for days together; but a burning thirst, in a tropical
climate, is terrible; and when the fever in the blood becomes aggravated by
such exertions as the British army had that day made, the whole world
seems valueless in comparison with a cup of cold water. None came, however,
for several hours; yet the gallant fellows bore the privation without
a murmur; and when the following day brought them a reinforcement of
two European regiments of infantry, with a small battery of heavy guns,
they felt that they were irresistible. Nevertheless, the general, with great
good sense, gave them two entire days to refresh; he had nothing to gain
by precipitating matters. Ferozepore had been saved by the battle of the
18th; and his communications with the place being in some sort restored,
he had time to warn Sir John Littler of his purposes, and to prepare
him for co-operating in their accomplishment. These were the chief
advantages of delay; besides that, others probably occurred to him,
namely, the opportunity which was afforded for the coming up of the
corps which had been directed to march from Delhi, Meerut, and other
stations. And on the part of the Sikhs, it was doubtless considered that
their very numbers would render a long halt on one spot impossible for
them; for no country, however fertile, can sustain the pressure of sixty
thousand men many days.—<i>Sir Hugh Gough’s Despatches.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_346" href="#FNanchor_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> A staff-officer, whose intellects were unsettled, had ridden back, as
soon as he saw that the enemy’s camp was won, and directed the artillery
and cavalry to retire upon Ferozepore, in order that men and horses
might refresh themselves. Not a gun, therefore, was with Sir Hugh
Gough; when Tej Singh with his army of reserve advanced against
him, and the murderous fire of round shot and shell which the latter
threw into the village where the British infantry stood met no reply.
Moreover, to advance from the village would necessarily expose the men
to almost certain destruction, because a powerful cavalry was ready to fall
upon the columns, while to remain as they were could accomplish
nothing, seeing that the enemy would never close with them; battles of
artillery being under all circumstances their favourites. But if an
accident brought the British infantry into the scrape, another accident
relieved them. The cavalry and artillery, moved as they had been
directed to do, after having suffered severely from the superior fire of the
Sikhs, which took them in flank, while the infantry were advancing to the
charge. Now, under the persuasion that a general retreat was ordered,
they pursued their course towards Ferozepore. The movement brought
them round the flank of the Sikhs, who, mistaking the object of it,
suddenly abandoned their guns and fled.</p></div>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
